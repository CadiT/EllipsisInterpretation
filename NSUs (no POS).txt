NSU -- Right. -- Ack

antecedent -- They moved the Hoover factory from France to -- Ack

antecedent -- I think I'll give you some homework that you could do for the week. -- Ack
NSU -- Right.  -- Ack

antecedent -- based on, what we do today will be based on -- Ack
NSU -- Okay. -- Ack

antecedent -- How many notes are there in a scale? -- ShortAns_arg
NSU -- Eight. -- ShortAns_arg

antecedent -- Eight. -- Ack
NSU -- Right. -- Ack

antecedent -- So each one of those is going to have a <pause> a name of its own -- Ack
NSU -- Yeah. -- Ack

antecedent -- You, you've probably heard that name before. -- Ack
NSU -- Yeah. -- Ack

antecedent -- Or in the key of G it would be A. -- RepAck
NSU -- A. -- RepAck

antecedent -- <pause> The mediant is the third degree of the scale -- Ack
NSU -- Yeah. -- Ack

antecedent -- Dominant means that it's important doesn't it? -- Ack
NSU -- Yeah. -- Ack

antecedent -- So that becomes submediant. -- Ack
NSU -- Right. -- Ack

antecedent -- So the dominant is five notes above the tonic and the subdominant is five notes below the tonic. -- Ack
NSU -- Right. -- Ack

antecedent -- So the dominant is five notes above the tonic and the subdominant is five notes below the tonic. -- Ack
NSU -- Yeah. -- Ack

antecedent -- That <trunc> jus </trunc> if, if you can keep the <pause> <trunc> th </trunc> the descriptions in your mind as well it just helps you to, to remember why each one is called that. -- Ack
NSU -- Yeah. -- Ack

antecedent -- Did you have to go as far as that? -- Reject
NSU -- No. -- Reject

antecedent -- No.  -- Ack
NSU -- Right. -- Ack

antecedent -- No.  -- Ack
NSU -- Okay. -- Ack

antecedent -- C to E major third. -- RepAck
NSU -- Major third. -- RepAck

antecedent -- But it is actually called a perfect octave as well. -- Ack
NSU -- Okay. -- Ack

antecedent -- You have C to -- Filler
NSU -- D flat. -- Filler

antecedent -- That becomes a minor second. -- Ack
NSU -- Right. -- Ack

antecedent -- Fourths and fifths you don't have minors.  -- Ack
NSU -- Right  -- Ack

antecedent -- That's the sixth. -- HelpReject
NSU -- Minor sixth. -- HelpReject

antecedent -- So you've then got a minor second, a third, a sixth and a seventh. -- Ack
NSU -- Right. -- Ack

antecedent -- must have, if it hasn't got another letter name then it's not a second is it? -- Ack
NSU -- Yeah. -- Ack

antecedent -- Now you can also have diminished intervals for the fifths and fourths. -- Ack
NSU -- Alright. -- Ack

antecedent -- C to A would be <pause> A double flat which would on a keyboard be a G. -- RepAck
NSU -- G. -- RepAck

antecedent -- Do you have to go through the minor? -- Reject
NSU -- No. -- Reject

antecedent -- bigger. -- Ack
NSU -- Oh yeah. -- Ack

antecedent -- So it's going the other way. -- Ack
NSU -- Right. -- Ack

antecedent -- So that would be a D sharp. -- RepAck
NSU -- A D sharp. -- RepAck

antecedent -- Which is two whole semitones less than the major interval -- Ack
NSU -- Yeah. -- Ack

antecedent -- And then you're gonna have a minor interval from each of the major intervals. -- Ack
NSU -- Yeah. -- Ack

antecedent -- A diminished interval from any of the intervals. -- ConjFrag
NSU -- And an augmented from any of the intervals as well. -- ConjFrag

antecedent -- And an augmented from any of the intervals as well. -- Ack
NSU -- Right. -- Ack

antecedent -- Let's call it by its proper name, tonic. -- RepAck

antecedent -- Augmented fifth would be a C sharp. -- Ack
NSU -- Right. -- Ack

antecedent -- C flat. -- RepAck
NSU -- C flat. -- RepAck

antecedent -- That's a fourth. -- Ack
NSU -- Oh yeah. -- Ack

antecedent -- That's right. -- Ack
NSU -- Yeah. -- Ack

antecedent -- That's right. -- Ack
NSU -- Okay. -- Ack

antecedent -- That's what we normally use it for and erm <pause> what I'm going to do if that's okay is I, I'll describe the erm <pause> the actual theory to you -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- And I've got a little chart that I'll give you to do that on. -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- And then erm we'll have three readings, really, of erm <pause> where you come -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- One of which is this erm estimate that you'll do now. -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- And then you've filled in a works situations -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- questionnaire, and that gives us another reading. -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- And then there's the proper questionnaire and I've scored that up. -- Ack
NSU -- Right. -- Ack

antecedent -- So we get three readings. -- CheckQu
NSU -- Okay? -- CheckQu

antecedent -- Now erm <pause> oh you've got a pen. -- FactMod
NSU -- Excellent. -- FactMod

antecedent -- The way it works is that the theory, the theory actually erm er has four dimensions. -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- And the idea is that that's the midpoint and there's a one to ten scale going each way. -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- And the theory is that every individual has an innate inborn preference for behaving at one end or the other. -- CheckQu
NSU -- Okay? -- CheckQu

antecedent -- Are you right or left handed? -- ShortAns_arg

NSU -- Er really strange actually. -- ShortAns_arg

antecedent -- and er I have a real problem with using my left hand. -- FactMod
NSU -- Oh interesting. -- FactMod

antecedent -- Erm and er the other thing about it is that although we have to look at, in order to discover the preference, we have to look at each dimension as a discrete entity, once you've found the preferences, they actually have a dynamic relationship with each other. -- Ack
NSU -- Right. -- Ack

antecedent -- works. -- CheckQu
NSU -- Okay? -- CheckQu

antecedent -- works. -- Ack
NSU -- Okay. -- Ack

antecedent -- This, this dimension is about er where you prefer to focus your attention and where you get your psychological energy from. -- CheckQu
NSU -- Okay? -- CheckQu

antecedent -- Erm and then, they may share. -- Ack
NSU -- Right. -- Ack

antecedent -- to write, or something to buy in town, or whatever you know -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- They thought it over and they've worked out, and they're not gonna come. -- Ack
NSU -- Right. -- Ack

antecedent -- Do I put a cross? -- AffAns
NSU -- Yes. -- AffAns

antecedent -- It's about perception. -- Ack

NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- In fact there were very few guide dogs at that time and erm I've never felt that erm it's, I mean maybe <pause> just my <pause> erm silliness really but I, I never wanted a dog lying about all day because once at the office I stayed put as it were until it was time to go home and I could have taken the dog I suppose during the lunch hour but I preferred that time to erm to reading -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- I think it was about forty four -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- but of course erm as a sort of public to the er, er a gesture to the public erm but one stage during the war when things were getting a bit grim on the war front, it was decided that erm, we should work extra hours as erm, <unclear> to show that we were pulling our weight <shift new=laughing> <unclear> <shift>, so we used to, instead of starting at nine o'clock until erm half past five, and working on Saturdays as well of course, erm, we had to start at half past eight and finish at six and it was a bit of a fiasco really because nobody erm, you know, well the end of the half past five you were pretty well tired out so erm the rest of the time <pause> -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- you were really kicking your heels and erm quite apart from which in the winter time the er conditions were pretty grim because they had the erm anti-splinter netting over the windows and erm big blinds which had to be drawn as soon as it was dusk because er, of course you weren't allowed to show a light and erm if that was <unclear> it became really thick -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- mm, I don't think the cleaners were all that erm good at their job, I mean they, they were, er perhaps that's a bit unfair to them to say that because erm the collection of dust was erm <shift new=laughing> pretty dreadful <shift> -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- with all the books and files around and er, it became, anybody with any chest troubles erm -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- found it <trunc> v </trunc> very difficult cos erm atmosphere as I say was erm really dreadful -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- it got very hot and erm stuffy and unpleasant -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- so erm, and that went on for, I suppose till the end of the war when er, when we had a reduction in hours again, we went back to the normal nine till half past five. -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- and erm <pause> I don't know what the idea really was, I think it was possibly so that erm, that people concerned with the Committee Meetings could erm sort themselves out and -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- at least as far as I can remember. -- Ack
NSU -- Mm mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- Oh, yes, yes , its erm, erm County Hall of course was the County Control Centre for erm air raid precautions -- Ack

NSU -- Yes, certainly, sorry. -- AffAns

antecedent -- Erm, the archway from St Helens is still there isn't it? -- AffAns
NSU -- Mm, yes. -- AffAns

NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- Erm, <trunc> interest </trunc> interestingly enough erm Cyril <gap reason=anonymization desc="last or full name"> was very friendly with er Tom's son Kenneth who was erm Planning Officer in some area now Sussex -- Ack
NSU -- Mm, mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- I think but continuing down the corridor erm which was all the Education Department, you came to the typists' room right at the bottom of the corridor on the left -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- and then erm turning right you went past the ladies' cloakroom and before you got to the door out into erm Grimwich Street -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- We're talking about East Suffolk of course -- Ack
NSU -- Yes. -- Ack

antecedent -- not erm the whole of Suffolk and erm the County Hall staff as a whole was divided into six shifts, erm and each shift was on duty for twenty four hours a day, for twenty four hours on -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- and erm so that erm the shift that was on say Sunday, would erm erm be on again on the Saturday and so it erm, you know you got a different day -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- each week and erm, the shift which was on duty say on Sunday would have Monday off, they were, they could erm go home on Monday -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- They were always erm, making caustic comments about the entries in the, in the log book which the telephonists had to keep, erm, of the messages that came through -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- <shift new=laughing> as you could imagine <shift> because erm they had all the whole building to erm to roam about in -- Ack
NSU -- Yes. -- Ack

antecedent -- and er, I think the younger people quite enjoyed it but the older ones, of course, found it bit of a bind, er particularly after erm the sort of patriotic fervour -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- wore off a bit, I mean there was erm, everybody was feeling very patriotic at the beginning of the war but after four or five years the erm novelty wore off -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- Was there any financial incentive for -- Reject
NSU -- Not <trunc> re </trunc> no, no, no, no.  -- Reject

antecedent -- But erm <pause> as far as financial incentive goes, erm <pause> it was about a year or so after erm I started there I think when er they introduced it, the erm war bonus, which was a supplement to normal salaries -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- But erm there were one or two little hiccups of that sort where erm temporary staff were erm regarded as a bit er <unclear> second rate citizens <unclear> -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- and erm, with all the erm younger men and some of the girls of course er, volunteered for the services -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- er we had quite a number of married women coming in to er, to work as part of their war effort and erm, so that <pause> there was quite, there was quite erm <pause> quick turnover of staff at that time -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- and erm <pause> to be fair to them, I don't think that erm some of them were particularly interested in, <shift new=laughing> in their work <shift> and er -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- story. -- Ack
NSU -- Yes. -- Ack

antecedent -- Very, very little really, erm we had contact with other Authorities of course, in the course, in erm er particularly in connection with evacuation, erm <pause> evacuation took up erm quite a lot of staff and, and time at that er particularly initially because erm Suffolk was in a peculiar position or at least the East Suffolk was, erm at the beginning of the war of course erm East Suffolk was an evacuation, er was erm a reception area -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- and erm it was really remarkable because er, I mean presumably the Germans were told about it and erm kept <unclear> U-boats and <shift new=laughing> <unclear> <shift> and the <unclear> from shipping out the er -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- and erm, then of course when they reached Felixstowe, everything was a bit chaotic because <trunc> th </trunc> they had to sleep on the floor in the schools down there -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- Did evacuation just take place over two or three days or? -- AffAns
NSU -- Yes, mm mm, -- AffAns

antecedent -- Yes, mm mm, -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- but erm it had sorted itself out after, well more or less after a week or two a lot of the evacuees of course didn't stay very long, they went back home because erm <pause> I know mother had a, a little boy from erm Guildford when we lived at Debenham and er he went back after a while, the mother used to come down and visit him from time to time, they were very, came from very poor circumstances and the -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- mother used to spend most of her time in the local when she did come and er -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- in the end she took the children home with her, erm it was so different from what they'd been used to in those erm -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- East, well in the East End particularly, Guildford was not much better -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- but erm <pause> erm <pause> anyway <pause> the erm children were absorbed into the schools of some sort -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- Then he went erm into the Navy for a short time and for some unknown reason he managed to get out of the Navy and came as Mr <gap reason=anonymization desc="last or full name"> 's Personal Assistant and erm one of his jobs was to erm get these <trunc> pe </trunc> children sorted out and I used to write no end of letters for him to erm places like erm Ilford and Wanstead and mainly the northern suburbs of London erm about certain children who had been attending central schools which were something, which were something that erm East Suffolk couldn't offer and erm trying to decide whether they ought to go to grammar school or one of the area schools as they <trunc> we </trunc> then were -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- in Suffolk and erm most complicated situations we got into. -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- The erm billeting actually was dealt with by a section connected with the er County Accountants Department -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- which subsequently became the Treasurers <pause> and erm <pause> they used to erm collect the contributions from, from parents and there again I got involved because they were short of typists at one time -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- And er oh you er it's social work you're interested in is it? -- AffAns
NSU -- Yes. -- AffAns

antecedent -- Well, and what experience have you got? -- Reject

antecedent -- bits to this would be erm I ran er a youth group in Ladywood which was er central Birmingham. -- Ack

antecedent -- And er we did a couple of weeks erm teaching in schools and we helped run a erm a lunching club for old people. -- Ack
NSU -- Oh yes. -- Ack

antecedent -- Well that I mean that <trunc> t </trunc> to get them in yeah that's the sort of thing we started with erm playing pool and er table tennis and that. -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- you know a ten, fifteen minute discussion and stuff like that. -- Sluice

antecedent -- how did they <pause> sort of cope with their relationships or anything like that? -- Reject
NSU -- No. -- Reject

antecedent -- the sort of thing that cropped up. -- Ack
NSU -- Yeah. -- Ack

antecedent -- So I mean it doesn't, I mean, I mean the point about social work erm <pause> you know doing <pause> er some experience is I think so that you actually experience the erm <pause> sort of <trunc> so </trunc> the, the group dynamics of people who are in trouble and can't cope. -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- If I were you I'd put the earphones in. -- Ack
NSU -- Yes. -- Ack

antecedent -- and which newspapers you think, even if you haven't made a final decision -- Ack
NSU -- Mhm. -- Ack

antecedent -- Six o'clock news erm -- ConjFrag
NSU -- And seven o'clock and nine -- ConjFrag

antecedent -- So she watched television and erm <pause> Princess Diana erm <pause> said something shocking at lunchtime at a luncheon party or lunch party and erm <pause> maybe just erm ten days before that Princess Diana's announcement we were told by the Register Teacher that we will have an assignment of in February and we will compare some newspapers articles and maybe she didn't explain very erm specifically but she just gave us erm the brief information about er register assignment in February and she told us that we should er we should collect some newspapers <pause> about the same title was about the same <pause> topic and <trunc> ho </trunc> we should compare how each newspaper treated, treats the <pause> er news or <pause> what do you call that? -- ShortAns_arg
NSU -- Well the news item the story, the story. -- ShortAns_arg

antecedent -- So the next day it was <trunc> Sa </trunc> Saturday er Saturday morning we went to <sic resp=LONGMAN> Jameson </sic> er <pause> can I call that that shop? -- RepAffAns

NSU -- Okay <sic resp=LONGMAN> Jameson </sic> er Bookshop in George Street and we bought six newspapers <pause> tabloid, three tabloid or er three  -- RepAck

antecedent -- <unclear> sheet. -- RepAck
NSU -- Broadsheet. -- RepAck

antecedent -- Peter, would you like to talk about language register in tabloids and broadsheets? -- AffAns
NSU -- Okay. -- AffAns

antecedent -- But very often I think tabloid journalism is interesting in terms of language <unclear> because it's very punchy it's succinct because <trunc> i </trunc> <trunc> i </trunc> in some of our terms you might find people into a three minute reader and a thirty minute reader <pause> because in attention span and intellectual capacity are quite different <pause> but to actually condense something <pause> into meaningful short bursts, even if they are politically biased actually requires a certain amount of skill I would suspect <vocal desc="clears throat"> the clarity index which I can't find is the process that I mentioned the other night where you take <pause> erm some people call it the fog index <pause> a <pause> correct me if I'm wrong in my figures, but I think it's a piece of something like two hundred or three hundred words <pause> you count the number of <trunc> suc </trunc> erm colons and full stops or is it only full stops? -- RepAffAns
NSU -- Full stops. -- RepAffAns

antecedent -- Full stops. -- RepAck
NSU -- Full stops. -- RepAck

antecedent -- You then count the number of words of more than two syllables -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- I mean like I saw a double-decker bus on the moon and that sort of stuff. -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- It may be highly critical that the actual language will be completely different in the register. -- Ack
NSU -- Yes. -- Ack

antecedent -- They will go for vocabulary which is highly charged with imagery and emotion. -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- The others will chip in if they agree, but they will <pause> they are, they are wanting to set a missile to move, they're wanting to send a bullet, they are wanting to <trunc> s </trunc> to evoke emotion or anger or rage or frustration or political bias or to change attitudes now for example the interesting thing about the Princess Diana erm the headline on one of those tabloids which talks about exile <pause> is I suspect that they want to evoke the constitutional crisis which there was at the time of <pause> -- Filler
NSU -- Edward. -- Filler

antecedent -- There was a special dispensation given to her to attend and in fact there were photographs at the time with the Queen with her. -- Ack
NSU -- Yes. -- Ack

antecedent -- But, but, but the whole social and cultural <pause> revolution evolution change has led I think to <pause> whole different schisms in the press which perhaps may have existed in some of the very one might almost say near communist publication like the <unclear> -- Filler
NSU -- Daily Worker. -- Filler

antecedent -- You'd be there six o'clock gone mate. -- FactMod
NSU -- Wonderful. -- FactMod

antecedent -- You see one of the other interesting things is that there is a <pause> essentially a tradition in this country that the Royal Family do not sue newspapers -- Ack
NSU -- Yes. -- Ack

antecedent -- There are various exceptions erm <pause> and there have been two or three in recent years, but it therefore meant that they were fair game for saying anything <pause> so they were fair game for a very sensational headline <pause> because there was very little chance of recrimination. -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- Now the view er was that they were dignified and above taking action <pause> and also in the sense that the public was credited I think with more sense than to believe everything <pause> and that the public memory is relatively short and therefore if you start a court action and you then have coverage in the court action, you are merely making the thing <pause> worse <pause> erm sometimes the things that some people may have thought were highly actionable one day, become almost a joke and something of affection later on and you can, one of the classics maybe is about the Prince of Wales talking to his plants, now that <unclear> a national joke and he will make jokes about it in speeches -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- and it's become <unclear> of the exchange of, of, of talk and of media erm <pause> but what else do we say about language register and vocabulary? -- ShortAns_arg
NSU -- Length of words -- ShortAns_arg

antecedent -- Length of words -- Ack
NSU -- Oh yes. -- Ack

antecedent -- I'm not sure, but I think when I studied this in college I think it was something like the average of <unclear> producers of vocabulary of less than two thousand words. -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- Do you think it would be greater now? -- Reject
NSU -- No, no actually no, not at all. -- Reject

antecedent -- I think that that is, is something that you know we looked at the <unclear> you know the Mirror that you know while thirty years ago they were doing short punchy stories and they maintained that, that there was actually <pause> -- Filler
NSU -- A wider range of vocabulary  -- Filler

antecedent -- I mean I think you'll find that erm <pause> that there was an <trunc> amaz </trunc> you know I mean that, that while the language might have been simple <pause> it wasn't simplistic <pause> and, but the change in a <pause> in a way now is <unclear> around. -- Ack
NSU -- Yeah. -- Ack

antecedent -- Do you know, do you know, am I being clear about that? -- AffAns

NSU -- Yes. -- Ack

antecedent -- I shall be getting a copy of this tape. -- Ack

antecedent -- It's gonna be about plus three, three plus. -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- Where's the X, where's the Y? -- ShortAns_arg
NSU -- X squared. -- ShortAns_arg

antecedent -- So it'll be something like <pause> X minus three X squared. -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- So X equal three or X equal three. -- Ack
NSU -- Yeah. -- Ack

antecedent -- Y would be six, <unclear>. <pause> -- Ack

NSU -- Hmm. -- Ack

antecedent -- Erm <pause> people might say oh well we'll take it from minus five to plus five. -- Ack
NSU -- Yeah. -- Ack

antecedent -- But you'd miss a lot of important points. -- Ack
NSU -- Yeah. -- Ack

antecedent -- But you're still missing out a big, very important part of the graph, because for a lot of its range it actually, you know, looks something like well what would that look like? -- ShortAns_arg

antecedent -- And what is the sign of it though? -- ShortAns_arg
NSU -- Minus. -- ShortAns_arg

antecedent -- It's the same <unclear> -- Ack
NSU -- Right. -- Ack

antecedent -- So <trunc> wh </trunc> when X is very big well, say, when it's big compared to ten -- Ack
NSU -- Yeah. -- Ack

antecedent -- this looks like Y equals minus X squared. <pause> -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- It's where most people throw it away on the sketches, they just pick a tiny, tiny portion and look at that in great detail, say ah, look at that, wonderful. -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- Tt, erm plotting graphs, you had one question didn't you where they asked a gradient? -- AffAns
NSU -- Yeah. -- AffAns

antecedent -- And you measured it with a protractor, -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- it was forty five degrees so you thought it was one, but the scale was two to one. -- Ack
NSU -- Yeah. <unclear> -- Ack

antecedent -- Same scale on the X and Y. Erm what would be <pause> let's say someone gave you this <pause> find an approximation for the gradient <pause> erm Y equals X squared <pause> minus one. <vocal desc=laugh> -- CE
NSU -- X squared? -- CE

antecedent -- you <trunc> d </trunc> you'd have to find Y. -- Ack
NSU -- Okay. -- Ack

antecedent -- So Y is three squared minus one. -- Ack
NSU -- Yeah okay. -- Ack

antecedent -- <unclear> be Y would equal eight. -- Ack

antecedent -- we are really er I'm preaching the company policy and also something I know that er works -- Ack

antecedent -- Right no qualifying in in in er I will tell you what the <unclear> erm er sort of policy on that or opinion on that is that if you have got er a closure on the phone. -- Ack
NSU -- Mhm. -- Ack

antecedent -- Now you must have at some time or other in advertising closed the deal on the phone. -- Ack
NSU -- Oh yeah mhm. -- Ack

antecedent -- Well that's that's what we mean by that. -- Ack
NSU -- Right. -- Ack

antecedent -- I have I would say that most of the people who answer yes who have been in say for instance home improvements -- Ack
NSU -- Mhm. -- Ack

antecedent -- Whereas we think -- Ack
NSU -- Yeah. -- Ack

antecedent -- it's more towards the no. -- Ack
NSU -- Yes. -- Ack

antecedent -- Because they cannot discuss the requirements on the phone. -- Ack
NSU -- Mhm. -- Ack

antecedent -- When you say those you mean the golf cards? -- AffAns
NSU -- Yeah. -- AffAns

antecedent -- That that type of idea. -- Ack
NSU -- Right. -- Ack

antecedent -- Well er er erm the the whole point of about asking that sort of question is that er I in my own mind I know where I think -- Ack
NSU -- Yeah. -- Ack

antecedent -- Er now we've got but we do have two products there of equal standing in terms of product er sorry of of erm salary potential -- Ack
NSU -- Mhm. -- Ack

antecedent -- remuneration -- Ack
NSU -- Yeah. -- Ack

antecedent -- Erm now John's on folders but there is another product range and that's the er -- Filler
NSU -- This one. -- Filler

antecedent -- Well G A <trunc> be </trunc> based in Perth of course is er one of our major clients up here. -- Ack
NSU -- Mhm. -- Ack

antecedent -- Er and once again they they they're all part of estates division and er you know they're as equally <trunc> valua </trunc> valuable to the er -- Ack
NSU -- Yeah yeah. -- Ack

antecedent -- Erm I know some companies actually sell send the large ones out -- Ack
NSU -- Yes. -- Ack

antecedent -- Yes they're not really meant to be sent out -- Ack
NSU -- Yeah. -- Ack

antecedent -- I have to say though first of all especially if they have the larger version -- Ack
NSU -- Mhm. -- Ack

antecedent -- Well thing is people are moving to an area they may be given some information by their company but -- Ack
NSU -- Mhm. -- Ack

antecedent -- You'd still be in estates division -- Ack
NSU -- Yeah. -- Ack

antecedent -- Erm but in the end it's all estates division anyway. -- Ack
NSU -- Yeah. -- Ack

antecedent -- Er while I'm having a look through this er Richard er over there we have erm a selection of the product selection of the product which erm we discussed briefly on the phone. -- Ack
NSU -- All right. -- Ack

antecedent -- There's a signature coming up is there? erm certainly the average cost of an ad if you took the most expensive and the least expensive across all of those products would come out somewhere in the region of six hundred pounds. -- CE
NSU -- Per ad? -- CE

antecedent -- Per ad? -- RepAffAns
NSU -- Per ad. -- RepAffAns

antecedent -- Per ad. -- Sluice
NSU -- But what size ad? -- Sluice

antecedent -- If you look at a full page when they happen, they don't happen all that often on a schools portfolio which costs two thousand two hundred pounds, you'll see there's there's already three different prices -- Ack
NSU -- Yeah. -- Ack

antecedent -- So you will go in you will never come out of a an advertiser with less commission than that. -- Ack
NSU -- Right. -- Ack

antecedent -- Unless you have discounted it and you give two or three pounds away when you do that. -- Ack
NSU -- Right. -- Ack

antecedent -- But in the main we are looking for er somewhere in the region of er hundred and eighty pounds per per per deal and we're looking for one of those a day average. -- Ack
NSU -- Mhm. -- Ack

antecedent -- Our top people earn top money because A they're not satisfied with one deal a day. -- Ack
NSU -- Mhm. -- Ack

antecedent -- An assignment being one complete -- Filler
NSU -- One complete product yes. -- Filler

antecedent -- Possibly a solicitor now they're allowed to advertise. -- RepAck
NSU -- And a solicitor. -- RepAck

antecedent -- The training course would certainly do that. -- Ack
NSU -- Right. -- Ack

antecedent -- said Richard he said, I don't know how you do it in London he said, if they ever asked me to come down here he said I would die. -- Ack

antecedent -- It's quite a different coloured pen. -- Ack
NSU -- Yeah. -- Ack

antecedent -- Well first of all whether the the whole environment of selling advertising appeals. -- Ack
NSU -- Mhm. -- Ack

antecedent -- But I've actually spoken to an even a a real Tyne and Wear Geordie accent -- Ack
NSU -- Yes. -- Ack

antecedent -- I say I'm sorry I cannot understand a word you're saying. -- Ack
NSU -- Yes. -- Ack

antecedent -- er so it wouldn't be any good for us. -- Ack
NSU -- Mhm. -- Ack

antecedent -- I say well it's definitely the latter. -- RepAck
NSU -- The latter. <vocal desc=laugh> -- RepAck

antecedent -- But there is a certain element of the former. -- Ack
NSU -- Yes. -- Ack

antecedent -- Because in any self employed situation you're always going to get people who find something quote better -- Ack
NSU -- Mhm. -- Ack

antecedent -- in their opinion and that's that and and they get it. -- Ack
NSU -- Mhm. -- Ack

antecedent -- Well when you when you understand er when you get to understand the products I mean there's there all our six companies are represented over there er Maggie -- Ack
NSU -- Right. -- Ack

antecedent -- And that is bring together the advertising to fund the product. -- Ack
NSU -- Mhm. -- Ack

antecedent -- you see this this this one you brought in here -- Ack
NSU -- Mhm. -- Ack

antecedent -- unless the local printer's very cleaver somehow and got that advertising to to sponsor er the booklet they've had to charge for it. -- Ack

antecedent -- And I was disappointed I went and say, Hey -- Ack
NSU -- Mm. -- Ack

antecedent -- by that time I'd been involved with <unclear>. -- Ack

antecedent -- It was costing them extra in postage -- Ack
NSU -- Mhm. -- Ack

antecedent -- and they kept asking us to print more. -- Ack
NSU -- Right. -- Ack

NSU -- Mhm. -- Ack

antecedent -- Schools universities and colleges they were a spin-off from the parents' choice charter. -- Ack
