The three are also believed to be implicated in other cases of serious violations against street children.  :: trueTo find which of the five is the most fragrant, we'll be holding a studio sniff-in on Morning Edition at 8.45am on Saturday August 31.  :: trueAt group level, the days have gone when three prisoners per group (one from the West, the East and a non-aligned country) were obligatory.  :: trueThe 25th Anniversary campaign had dramatic results: individual membership increased from 25,000 at the end of 1985 to 35,000 at the end of 1986: a full 30 per cent increase in one year.  :: trueA beer cask can come in several sizes: a pin (4.5 gallons), a firkin (9), a kilderkin (18), a barrel (36) and a hogshead (54).  :: trueThere were six of them, five with small slices taken out and the sixth with the knife still in it.  :: true�Thirty thousand in round figures.  :: trueCalculations were taken from the original bear to produce drawings, reducing it from three to two dimensions. :: trueThousands queued to sign an unofficial book of condolence at the Xinhua News Agency.  :: truePlants can be bought in tens of thousands for 50 cents each in Bangkok, and sold for $10-$15 in the West.  :: true Though it has to be said, he wrote, and Goldberg, his eye racing down the page covered in his friend's tiny handwriting, paused to sip from the glass of fresh orange-juice at his side, wiped his forehead and went on typing, it has to be said that I have occasionally had the illusion that I knew what step to take first and even, occasionally, what step to take second, I will not talk about a third. :: true It is perfectly true that there is nothing conclusively in the poem to make us identify the first stair with Dante's Inferno , the second with his Purgatorio , the third with Paradiso ; as there is not (a more piercing uncertainty) anything to determine for us whether �the broadbacked figure drest in blue and green�, with his �music of the flute�, is an image of what must be renounced in order to achieve Paradise, or else an image of how terrestrial life can most nearly attain the paradisal. :: trueThe first two tasks, though hideously difficult, were at least relatively straightforward; the third posed the problem which is at the heart of Peter Dennis's book: whose law was to be restored and what civilian authority should take over? :: trueAnd the third was as a confessor, because he knew that many souls valued him in this work.  :: trueBut I'm gonna have to there are only two girls in the lower sixth. :: trueSeveral were in groups of four, three standing slabs of stone over which a fourth lay as a roof, others lay tumbled in meaningless heaps, but still others seemed to be set in distinguishable lines and circles. :: trueThe red bitch was the seventh in a line of dogs that had belonged to Kalchu's family since his grandfather had brought the first one back from Tibet some forty years previously.  :: trueOur very existence proves the first, and the third is acknowledged to be a product of human life.  :: trueOne doesn't have to start capsize drill in a closed cockpit and Ms Wynne-Freer contradicts the statements in her fourth paragraph with those made in her tenth. :: trueThe third is a less tangible but no less striking phenomenon, the general feeling for freedom that has come over us all, an understanding heightened by the recent escape of millions of people by 1990 from the miseries of authoritarian rule and command economies. :: trueIt is left to the reader to plot these points on figure 10.3, and to connect the first and third. :: true�YOUR HORSE FELL AT THE FIFTH. :: trueMaisie sat in the corner of the kitchen with one chocolate bar in her mouth, another in her right hand, another in her lap and a fourth beside her on the draining board, in case anything should happen to the other three.  :: true 1168 Arsenal won their first five matches and did not lose until the tenth. :: trueNevertheless, the grammar schools existing separately from secondary modern schools edgily defended their difference and their rights � even if one of them had only six pupils in the upper sixth. :: trueThe first are designed to present a formidable appearance in front of a crowd; the second are sent into a crowd to disperse and/or incapacitate people with truncheons; and the third are used to create a fear and scatter effect. :: trueOne removes the red blood cells, leaving the plasma; the second removes the fatty cholesterol.  :: trueThe first is the amounts of money to be made in the business.  :: trueThe Army's new anti-tank weapons are being designed with �tandem warheads�; the first explodes reactive armour and the second penetrates the shell of the tank. :: trueBut, inexorably, each atoning lapse is easier than the last. :: trueFrenzied production one week gives way to nothing the next. :: trueZack had made eight calls in thirteen days � the ninth was about to come in. :: trueThe second is that drivers like to retain at least one common link with those fans who don't have private jets, Boss jeans, impossibly lithe blondes etc.  :: trueThe first is Thomas v.

He spends his days sketching passers-by, or trying to. At night he returns to the condemned building he calls home. His life, including his skirmishes with a competing sketch artist, seems carefree. He is his own man.  :: false With the biggest wine-buying period of the year looming as the holidays approach, it will be interesting to see how the superpremiums fare. By January it should be fairly clear what's hot -- and what's not.  :: false The framers hardly discussed the appropriations clause at the Constitutional Convention of 1787, according to Madison's notes. To the extent they did, their concern was to ensure fiscal accountability. Moreover, the framers believed that the nation needed a unitary executive with the independence and resources to perform the executive functions that the Confederation Congress had performed poorly under the Articles of Confederation. It would contradict that objective if the appropriations clause ( technically a limitation on legislative power ) could be read as placing the president on Congress's short leash, making the executive consist of the president and every member of Congress.  :: false In point of fact, volatility as measured by the annualized standard deviation of daily stock price movements has frequently been much higher than it is today. Periods before the advent of futures or program trading were often more volatile, usually when fundamental market conditions were undergoing change ( 1973-75, 1937-40, and 1928-33 for example ). It is interesting to see the fundamental stock pickers scream "foul " on program trading when the markets decline, while hailing the great values still abounding as the markets rise. Could rising volatility possibly be related to uncertainty about the economics of stocks, instead of the evil deeds of program-trading goblins ?  :: false I was pleased to note that your Oct. 23 Centennial Journal item recognized the money-fund concept as one of the significant events of the past century. Actually, about two years ago, the Journal listed the creation of the money fund as one of the 10 most significant events in the world of finance in the 20th century. But the Reserve Fund, America's first money fund, was not named, nor were the creators of the money-fund concept, Harry Brown and myself. We innovated telephone redemptions, daily dividends, total elimination of share certificates and the constant $ 1 pershare pricing, all of which were painfully thought out and not the result of some inadvertence on the part of the SEC.  :: false Finally, I think it important to point out the extraordinarily high visibility of non-violent civil disobedience in these days of intensive media coverage. Give television a chance to cover live any breaking of the law, and no second invitation will be required. This brings into question the motives of those who lead civil disobedience demonstrations. Do they want the spotlight for themselves or for their cause ? Here is a good rule of thumb : If the movement produced the leader, the chance that he is sincere is much greater than if the leader produced the movement. In either case, ask yourself whether you have become better informed on the issues under protest by watching the act of civil disobedience. If you have not, it is probable that a thorough airing of the dispute by calm and rational debate would have been the better course.  :: false By concentrating all their resources on the pay raise, Wright and Tower, the networks actually overlooked some major stories that showed the flaws and shortcomings of the institution.... An imaginative producer could easily have created a fast-moving and interesting piece about how Congress really works -- and why voters in, say, West Virginia got a federally funded university project and building while voters in Arkansas did not. But nobody did such a piece, reflecting a contemporary axiom : the more a scandal has to do with a congressman's duties as a congressman, the less likely it is to catch the fancy of a network.  :: false The uncertainty is sending shivers through Brazilian financial markets. The dollar, the best indicator of the country's mood, has skyrocketed on the parallel market, as has gold. Capital flight is reported to be strong.  :: false But the Americans are also to blame. They long made little effort here. IBM, though long a leader in the Japanese mainframe business, didn't introduce its first PC in Japan until five years after NEC did, and that wasn't compatible even with the U.S. IBM standard. Apple didn't introduce a kanji machine -- one that handles the Chinese characters of written Japanese -- until three years after entering the market. Critics also say American companies charge too much. Japan's FTC says it is investigating Apple for allegedly discouraging retailers from discounting.  :: false One could imagine such a lull in the lives of the Arabs before the quadrupling of oil prices. For just as the Arabs were in the 1960s, the farmers of Sidhpur are on the brink of global power and fame. The Arabs had merely oil. These farmers may have a grip on the world's very heart. Or, at least, its heart disease.  :: false But as astounding as the changes that have already occurred are, there is a fragility to glasnost. Censorship isn't a Marxist invention. The czars were no civil libertarians. As late as the 1890s, the Russian government prevented any coverage of famines. It even directed newspapers not to publish anything that might stain the honor of the Turkish sultan's wives. So glasnost is not a value woven with steel threads into the fabric of Russian society. It is an admirable public relations program initiated by a single political leader during a four-year blink of history. It is public relations of the highest sophistication, that recognizes that credibility is enhanced by honesty -- up to a point.  :: false Although acquiring a foreign company would expand Japanese advertising agencies' business to foreign clients, many clients would also be Japanese companies expanding overseas, says the Dentsu spokesman. But the different business system would make it hard for Dentsu to provide these Japanese companies the same kind of services they do in Japan.  :: false Environmental concerns are beginning to have as much influence in oil-industry spending plans as the price of crude does.  :: false Her new line of work has some perils. Recently, a contractor saved her from falling three stories as she investigated what remained of an old Victorian house torched by an arsonist. "I owe that contractor. I really do," she says.  :: false Admittedly last season's runaway hit, "Steel Magnolias," helped a lot, but so did cost cutting and other measures insisted on by the board. Only time will tell if Mr. Boyd can restore to the Alley the acclaim it received when its founder, Nina Vance, was at the height of her powers. But it is clear he is going to give it a shot.  :: false Republican senators, unwilling to concede the popular IRA issue to Democrats, suddenly embraced a scheme Sen. Roth had been pressing with little success. The Bush administration, which was planning to unveil an IRA proposal of its own next year, was quick to do the same. Both proposals would allow withdrawals not only for retirement, but also for buying a house or paying tuition bills.  :: false All of which has enabled those of us in Washington who enjoy wallowing in such things to go into high public dudgeon, as Mr. Apple and I did the other night on ABC's " Nightline. " away, we raised what I still think were all the right issues and landed more than one hard blow, but at the end of the affair, there was just the tiniest nagging worry that we had been aiming at the wrong target. As one of his defenders so aptly put it, President Reagan was simply doing what he had always done before his election ( and some would say thereafter as well ). He was performing for pay, and why should anyone expect anything more ?  :: false Linda and Michael ( Ms. Close and Mr. Woods ), who seem to be pushing 40, live in a large and tastefully decorated home in suburban Seattle. All of their friends have children and they can't, so now they want a child more than anything -- perhaps even more than Michael wanted his fancy convertible or his deluxe stereo equipment. The idea of a child-as-required-yuppie-possession must be motivating them, since the wealthy offspring of their friends are shown to be rude brats, in therapy by age five.  :: false The Bank of England, on the other hand, had gold reserves that averaged about 30 % of its outstanding currency, and Bank of England notes were accepted throughout the world. The most likely reason for this disparity is that the Bank of England was a private bank with substantial earning assets, and the common-law rights of creditors to collect claims against the bank were well established in Britain. By contrast, in 19th-century Russia an authoritarian government owned the bank and had the power to revoke payment whenever it chose, much as it would in today's Soviet Union.  :: false While rights fees head skyward, ad rates won't. Advertisers already are balking at higher prices. "The networks are paying too much for rights," warns adman Paul Isacsson of Young & Rubicam. " they ask advertisers to absorb the costs, they're likely to lose all but a few who need sports, above all."  :: false In Houston, we have seen how bad the housing problem can become. Unused houses deteriorate rapidly, affecting the value of nearby homes ; in a domino effect, the entire neighborhood can fall victim. At this stage some people just " away " from homes where the mortgage exceeds current market value. But most of them could have afforded to keep up their payments -- they chose not to do so.  :: false Poland's 2.7 million small private farms cover 76 % of its arable land. On it, a quarter of the country's 39 million people produce three-quarters of its grain, beef, eggs and milk, and nine-tenths of its fruit, vegetables and potatoes. Like the Roman Catholic Church, the Polish peasant is a pillar of the nation. Try as they might, the Communists could neither replace nor break him. And they did try.  :: false Despite their ubiquity, the consultants aren't entirely welcome. Some lawyers and scholars see the social scientists' vision of the American jury system as a far cry from the ideal presented in civics texts and memorialized on the movie screen. In the film classic "Twelve Angry Men," the crucible of deliberations unmasks each juror's bias and purges it from playing a role in the verdict. After hours of conflict and debate, that jury focuses on the facts with near-perfect objectivity. In real life, jurors may not always work that way, but some court observers question why they shouldn't be encouraged to do so rather than be programmed not to.  :: false Why can't we teach our children to read, write and reckon ? It's not that we don't know how to, because we do. It's that we don't want to. And the reason we don't want to is that effective education would require us to relinquish some cherished metaphysical beliefs about human nature in general and the human nature of young people in particular, as well as to violate some cherished vested interests. These beliefs so dominate our educational establishment, our media, our politicians, and even our parents that it seems almost blasphemous to challenge them.  :: false Ronald Kirk, president, says Lloyd's has suffered because its structure doesn't allow underwriters to deal directly with clients ; brokers are required intermediaries. Thus, he asserts, Lloyd's can't react quickly to competition. "Lloyd's has lost control of the situation," he says. "They aren't controlling their destiny like they used to."  :: false Which cars do Americans favor most these days ? It's hard to generalize, but age seems to be the best predictor. Adults under age 30 like sports cars, luxury cars, convertibles and imports far more than their elders do. Three of every 10 buyers under 30 would prefer to buy a sports car, compared with just 16 % of adults 30 and over, according to the Journal survey.  :: false That would give the Pentagon flexibility that no other federal agency has. "It's simply a way of making the cuts less onerous for defense than they are for domestic programs," said Chairman James Sasser ( D., Tenn. ) of the Senate Budget Committee, who said he would oppose the request. "That isn't consistent with the kind of discipline that Gramm-Rudman is supposed to impose," he said.  :: false The arbs may recoup some of their paper losses if the UAL deal gets patched up again, as they did in 1982 when Occidental Petroleum Co. rescued them with a $ 4 billion takeover of Cities Service.  :: false Barbara Donovan, an expert on East Germany at Radio Free Europe in Munich, says Mr. Krenz may project a smooth image, but she doubts he's a true reformer. Even if he is, she adds, he appears to have only limited room for maneuver within the Communist Party's ruling Politburo.  :: false The number of misclassified workers may be in the millions, mostly paid by small firms. Many workers, especially professionals, want to remain independent to avoid tax withholding and to continue to deduct many expenses that employees can't. But many others, who want to qualify for employee benefits and unemployment compensation, become tipsters for the IRS, says Jerry Lackey, who manages the IRS project's force of nine agents in north and central Florida from Orlando. Firms that are paying employment taxes also provide leads to competitors that aren't, he says.  :: false "This is one where I cross party lines," she says, rejecting the anti-abortion stance of Rep. Florio's opponent, Reagan-Republican Rep. James Courter. "People my age thought it wasn't going to be an issue. Now it has -- especially for people my age."  :: false Traditional no-loads made their money by charging an annual management fee, usually a modest one ; they imposed no other fees, and many still don't. In recent years, though, a passel of others flying the no-load flag have been imposing hefty charges -- all the way up to 6 % -- when an investor sells his shares. Shouldn't they properly be called exit-load funds ? The mutual-fund industry is debating the question, but don't expect a new name while the old one is working so well.  :: false While this theory is exceedingly simple, it appears to explain several things. First, why ticket splitting has increased and taken the peculiar pattern that it has over the past half century : Prior to the election of Franklin Roosevelt as president and the advent of the New Deal, government occupied a much smaller role in society and the prisoner's dilemma problem confronting voters in races for Congress was considerably less severe.  :: false What complicates the scene in Cambodia is that the current regime is already communist, as are its Vietnamese overseers back in Hanoi, as are the Khmer Rouge -- who are the strongest of the three guerrilla groups. It's not clear which crew of communists might prevail in a coalition government, but the one good bet is that the non-communists would disappear. That would leave Hun Sen and the Khmer Rouge.  :: false But these proposals do not rest on a view of what the Fed's problem is or, if they do, they rest on an incorrect view. They would not solve the problem ; they would make it worse. The problem is not that the Fed is too unresponsive to the public interest. On the contrary, it is too responsive to an incorrect view of the public interest.  :: false Fireman's Fund had claims adjusters on the streets of San Francisco right after sunrise yesterday and was paying as many claims as it could right on the spot. Fireman's Fund insures37,300 homes and autos and35,000 businesses in the Bay area. In addition to paying for earthquake and fire damage, the insurer must cover worker-compensation claims and also losses due to businesses being shut down by lack of power or phone service.  :: false SUGAR : Futures prices extended Tuesday's gains. The March delivery ended with an advance of 0.16 cent a pound to 14.27 cents, for a two-day gain of 0.3 cent. According to one dealer, Japan said it has only40,000 tons of sugar remaining to be shipped to it this year by Cuba under current commitments. The announcement was made because of reports Tuesday that Cuba would delay shipments to Japan scheduled for later this year, into early next year. The dealer said the quantity mentioned in the Japanese announcement is so small that it's meaningless. One analyst said he thought the market continued to be supported to some degree by a delay in the Cuban sugar harvest caused by adverse weather. The dealer said India might be the real factor that is keeping futures prices firm. That country recently bought200,000 tons of sugar and had been expected to seek a like quantity last week but didn't. "It's known they need the sugar, and the expectation that they will come in is apparently giving the market its principal support," the dealer said.  :: false Educators added that Next needs to soon offer a color version of its computer. Every major maker offers computers with color displays. Next won't comment on when it will do the same, but is believed to have a color model under development.  :: false But there never was a chance that the Afghan resistance would overthrow the Kabul regime quickly and easily. Soviet leaders said they would support their Kabul clients by all means necessary -- and did. The U.S. said it would fully support the resistance -- and didn't.  :: false The company had been experiencing softening margins because of increased sales of software applications, which have lower margins than do operating systems. But the company said that trend was offset in the first quarter by better economies of scale and efficiencies in manufacturing.  :: false Of course, the relative calm could be jolted if the market plunges again. And any strong surge in redemptions could force some funds to dump stocks to raise cash, as some did during Black Monday.  :: false On Friday, the market makers, who must be prepared to buy stock when no one else will, were frantically cutting the prices at which they would take stocks off sellers' hands, in reaction to plunging prices on the New York Stock Exchange, according to Mr. Rosenbach.  :: false If takeover premiums become excessive, if LBO dealmakers become too aggressive, then the private market will recognize these problems more quickly and accurately than will policy makers, and the markets will move with lightning speed to impose appropriate sanctions. Yes, the broader exchanges got caught up in the spiral, but they rode the tiger up all year. Not surprisingly, he sometimes bites.  :: false Despite a decade-long attempt to revamp the socialist economy, China's mega-welfare state is alive and well. Health care is free, housing costs just pennies and food is heavily subsidized. At Panzhihua, as in other big state-run factories, workers still can count on a cradle-to-grave safety net. Factory officials estimate that more than 10 % of the work force here is redundant, but layoffs aren't allowed. Even factory workers' children are guaranteed jobs. The industrial monoliths are so deeply involved in the welfare system that China's leaders may never be able to modernize them, despite their glaring economic inefficiency. Though the Panzhihua factory itself is profitable, many such enterprises aren't. Subsidies for money-losing enterprises totaled $ 18 billion last year, or about one-third the total state revenue.  :: false If foreigners dump U.S. stocks and return to the safety of their home markets -- as they did in October 1987 -- they must simultaneously also sell dollars for their own currencies. Those transactions, in turn, could weaken the dollar. Even if foreigners just withhold from buying additional U.S. securities, they reduce the demand for dollars.  :: false Don't say the TV sitcom, because that happens to be a genre that, in its desperate need to attract everybody and offend nobody, resembles politics more than it does comedy. It is true that the best sitcoms do allow group differences to simmer : yuppies vs. blue-collar Bostonians in "Cheers " ; children vs. adults in "The Cosby Show." But these are not the differences that make headlines.  :: false Good service programs require recruitment, screening, training and supervision -- all of high quality. They involve stipends to participants. Full-time residential programs also require housing and full-time supervision ; they are particularly expensive -- more per participant than a year at Stanford or Yale. Non-residential programs are cheaper, but good ones still come to some $10,000 a year. Are they worth that ? Evaluations suggest that good ones are -- especially so if the effects on participants are counted. But the calculations are challengeable.  :: false It's appropriate for U.S. officials to keep hammering for more open trade policies, as U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills did in Seoul last week. But there's also sometimes a tendency in American political circles to pick especially on South Korea, out of frustration over our inability to do much about Japan. That's counterproductive.  :: falseWould that be okay for you David? Yeah. <pause> :: falseAnd you want to know whether it would be more expensive. Mhm. :: falseTraidcraft? No. :: falseDominant means that it's important doesn't it? Yeah. :: falseYou have C to D flat. :: falseSo it's going the other way. Right. :: falseThat's right.
