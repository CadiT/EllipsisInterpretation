But maintaining U.S. influence will be difficult in the face of Japanese dominance in the region. Japan not only outstrips the U.S. in investment flows but also outranks it in trade with most Southeast Asian countries ( although the U.S. remains the leading trade partner for all of Asia ). Moreover, the Japanese government, now the world's largest aid donor, is pumping far more assistance into the region than the U.S. is. While U.S. officials voice optimism about Japan's enlarged role in Asia, they also convey an undertone of caution. "There's an understanding on the part of the U.S. that Japan has to expand its functions " in Asia, says J. Michael Farren, undersecretary of commerce for trade.

These securities are attractive to Japanese investors for three reasons. First, they are safe. While they aren't backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, as Treasury bonds are, it is widely assumed that the government would support them if necessary. ( U.S. Treasury bonds are still the dollar-denominated investment of choice for long-term Japanese investors ). Second, they are liquid. The secondary market in federally backed mortgage securities now exceeds $ 900 billion, or nearly half of the $ 2.2 trillion in U.S. residential mortgages issued. Third, they offer high yields. At the moment, some offer as much as 1.6 to 1.8 percentage points over Treasury securities of similar maturities.  :: false

Finally, the case of Dr. Morgan gave Congress an opportunity to act with unaccustomed decisiveness and to engage in one of its favorite pastimes -- bashing the District of Columbia government.

The junk-mail titans, ever optimistic, are looking for ways around the problem. So far, they say, it hasn't had any noticeable effect on response rates. And before it does, they're trying to cut back on the clutter that created the situation in the first place.

Supermarkets are getting into the variety act, too. They still buy apples mainly for big, red good looks -- that's why so many taste like woodchucks' punching bags. But freshness counts more than it once did, and stores are expanding shelf space for unconventional, but tastier, and often pricier, apples. " than sell 39-cents-a-pound Delicious, maybe we can sell 79-cents-a-pound Fujis," says Chuck Tryon, perishables director for Super Valu Inc., a Minneapolis supermarket chain and food distributor.  :: false
Given the prelude's thematic connections with the music preceding the last act, the idea is more worn than bad, though as luck would have it, for a change there actually was a conductor in the pit whom we wanted to hear, Carlos Kleiber, trying to make memorable music while we all waited for the bed lump to stir into song. Once she did so, the big-souled German maestro with the shaky nerves who so often cancels offered a limpid, flowing performance that in its unswagged and unswaggering approach was totally at odds with the staging.  :: false
Some litigators scoff at the notion that a sociologist knows more than they do about what makes a jury tick. "The essence of being a trial lawyer is understanding how people of diverse backgrounds react to you and your presentation," says Barry Ostrager of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, who recently won a huge case on behalf of insurers against Shell Oil Co. He says he used consultants in the case but " them to be virtually useless."  :: false
Particularly touchy are the cases of New York, which is Drexel's base, and California, the base of Drexel's highly profitable junk-bond operation that led to the firm's legal difficulties. Neither state has settled, and officials in the two states won't discuss their reasons for not doing so. But Drexel has made it clear it could mount a significant legal battle in each state if its license is revoked, according to state officials.  :: false
Mr. Roman's departure isn't expected to have any enormous repercussions at Ogilvy. American Express, Kraft General Foods, and Mattel executives said the move won't affect their relationships with the ad agency. "General Foods's relationships with its agencies are based on the agencies' work, and will continue to be," said David Hurwitt, a vice president of Kraft General Foods.  :: false
Many Japanese think it only natural that the organizations or their members would donate to politicians, the way many Japanese do, to win favor or support.  :: false
Out on the streets, some residents of badly damaged buildings were allowed a 15-minute scavenger hunt through their possessions. "It's so weird to have to decide what's really important to you," said Barbara May. She went first for personal mementos. In post-earthquake parlance, her building is a "red." After being inspected, buildings with substantial damage were color-coded. Green allowed residents to re-enter ; yellow allowed limited access ; red allowed residents one last entry to gather everything they could within 15 minutes.  :: false
We badly need to follow fact rather than the rhetoric of conventional wisdom. Without this basic level of attention to reality, our policies on Cuba will continue to be as counterproductive as they have for 30 years. From my own point of view, given the qualities of humanity, creativity and warm spirit in which the Cuban people excel, we deny ourselves access to things we hold dear, and which seem to run in such short supply these days. There is no rational justification for such behavior.  :: false
But while history can suggest what is reasonable to expect there's no guarantee that the past will repeat itself. For instance, some analysts believe bond returns and volatility have moved permanently closer to those of the stock market. And returns on cash investments may continue to exceed inflation by a wider margin than they did over the long-term past.  :: false
While the promises of big profits ought to set off warning bells, they often don't, in part because get-rich-quick tales have become embedded in American folklore.  :: false
Because wholesale energy prices shot up by a steep 6.5 % last month, many analysts expected energy prices to rise at the consumer level too. As a result, many economists were expecting the consumer price index to increase significantly more than it did.  :: false
Evaluating asset-backed securities poses another problem. Investors, for instance, may mistakenly assume that the bank or company that originally held the assets is guaranteeing the securities. It isn't.  :: false
A program called Notes, which is under development by Lotus, also is designed to sort E-mail sent within work groups. One thing that makes E-mail difficult to sift through is that each item looks the same. Notes, which is designed for advanced computers that display graphics, allows mail senders to put different logos on their mail. A daily news briefing from the company librarian, for example, would have a distinctive format on the screen, just as a paper version would have.  :: false
Bell Atlantic posted a strong earnings gain for the third quarter, as did Southern New England Telecommunications. But Nynex, Pacific Telesis and U S West had lower profits.  :: false

This temblor-prone city dispatched inspectors, firefighters and other earthquake-trained personnel to aid San Francisco. But a secondary agenda among officials in the City of Angels was to learn about the disaster-contingency plans that work and those that don't.  :: false
But car-happy Americans panicked, and so did the U.S. and other oil-consuming governments. "Shortage " and "crisis " became buzz words, although neither really applied. The spot dislocations that showed up were largely the result of confusion ( much of it in Washington ), though that was cold comfort for drivers waiting in mile-long lines at the gas pumps.  :: false
It can be hard for a salesperson to fight off feelings of discouragement. Brian Petre, a former Wang salesman in upstate New York, says : "You have pride in your job. You think you can go out and turn things around. It's a tough thing when you can't. The reason doesn't relate to your selling skills."  :: false
It isn't surprising that President Bush hasn't led a crusade to pump up the Contras or SDI. Though he nominally supports both programs, Mr. Bush hasn't been a passionate champion of either cause, as Mr. Reagan was.  :: false
But now, the magazine is attempting to fight back, with an ambitious plan including a revamped sales strategy and a surprisingly aggressive ad campaign. Advertisers don't think of the magazine first, says Joan McCraw, who joined in April as national advertising director. "What we want to do is take a more aggressive stance. People didn't believe we were in tune with the marketplace, and in many ways we weren't."  :: false
Despite his racial advantage, to be a great butler is a heroic calling ; one's pantry is " unlike general's headquarters during a battle." If, for example, in the midst of a great social occasion ( such as an international conference on revising the Versailles Treaty in 1923 ), one's 72-yearold father, himself a great butler once, should happen to die of a stroke, one must continue to serve the port : " don't think me unduly improper in not ascending to see my father in his deceased condition just at this moment. You see, I know my father would have wished me to carry on just now." It is this kind of dignity and restraint that allows Stevens to declare : " all its sad associations, whenever I recall that evening today, I find I do so with a large sense of triumph." We note the imperial public word used to deny private rage and sorrow. That Stevens himself is not grotesque or repellent, but funny and sad and enlightening, is entirely the author's triumph.  :: false
Even though National Geographic offers far more readers than does a magazine like Smithsonian, "the page costs you an arm and a leg to develop any frequency," says Harry Glass, New York media manager for Bozell Inc.  :: false
Meanwhile, Peter DaPuzzo, Shearson's head of retail equity trading, praised institutional investors in the OTC market, who were heavy buyers of the Nasdaq's biggest technology issues yesterday amid a flood of selling by other investors. "The institutions can't be criticized for their behavior," Mr. DaPuzzo said in an interview. "It was the opposite of what happened on Oct. 19. They used their judgment. They didn't panic during the first round of selling this morning. Instead, they bought on weakness and sold into the strength, which kept the market orderly. Maybe they learned from experience."  :: false
"I do not regard the amount of the decline on Friday as unexpected or unlikely," he said in a telephone interview. " the market being up to2,700 or2,800 and the existence of derivative products... one can expect volatility of the magnitude we had."  :: false
But securities analysts say Phillips will be among the companies hard-hit by weak chemical prices and will probably post a drop in third-quarter earnings. So, too, many analysts predict, will Exxon Corp., Chevron Corp. and Amoco Corp.  :: false
Market makers keep supplies of stock on hand to maintain orderly trading when imbalances occur. On days like Friday, that means they must buy shares from sellers when no one else is willing to. When selling is so frenzied, prices fall steeply and fast. Two years ago, faced with the possibility of heavy losses on the stocks in their inventories, market makers themselves began dumping shares, exacerbating the slide in OTC stock prices.  :: false
Now, dozens of corporations, including Ethan Allen, TW Services and York International, that are counting on at least $ 7 billion of scheduled new junk financings to keep their highly leveraged takeovers and buy-outs afloat, may never get the money. "The music has stopped playing," says Michael Harkins, a principal in the investment firm of Levy Harkins. "You've either got a chair or you don't."  :: false
But now, with Bull in firm control, these U.S. operations are key ingredients in Mr. Lorentz's plans to ensure that Bull remains one of the half-dozen or so world-wide, full-range computer companies likely to survive the 1990s. To do so, Bull is planting itself firmly in the U.S., where, says Mr. Lorentz, a lot of the best people and research are. The Zenith buy means Bull will derive 22 % of its revenue from the U.S. -- up from 18 % previously -- and the company spends 30 % of its 3.64 billion-franc research and development budget in the U.S.  :: false
