Not only is development of the new company's initial machine tied directly to Mr. Cray, so is its balance sheet. Documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the pending spinoff disclosed that Cray Research Inc. will withdraw the almost $ 100 million in financing it is providing the new firm if Mr. Cray leaves or if the product-design project he heads is scrapped.  = VPE
Analysts noted yesterday that Cray Research's decision to link its $ 98.3 million promissory note to Mr. Cray's presence will complicate a valuation of the new company.

But Sony ultimately took a lesson from the American management books and fired Mr. Katzenstein, after he committed the social crime of making an appointment to see the venerable Akio Morita, founder of Sony.

But it is Mr. Lane, as movie director, producer and writer, who has been obsessed with refitting Chaplin's Little Tramp in a contemporary way. In 1976, as a film student at the Purchase campus of the State University of New York, Mr. Lane shot "A Place in Time," a 36-minute black-and-white film about a sketch artist, a man of the streets. Now, 13 years later, Mr. Lane has revived his Artist in a full-length movie called "Sidewalk Stories," a poignant piece of work about a modern-day tramp. Of course, if the film contained dialogue, Mr. Lane's Artist would be called a homeless person. So would the Little Tramp, for that matter.  = VPE
I say " dialogue " because "Sidewalk Stories " isn't really silent at all. Composer Marc Marder, a college friend of Mr. Lane's who earns his living playing the double bass in classical music ensembles, has prepared an exciting, eclectic score that tells you what the characters are thinking and feeling far more precisely than intertitles, or even words, would.  = VPE
The Artist has his routine. He spends his days sketching passers-by, or trying to. At night he returns to the condemned building he calls home. His life, including his skirmishes with a competing sketch artist, seems carefree. He is his own man.  = VPE

This story line might resonate more strongly if Mr. Lane had as strong a presence in front of the camera as he does behind it.  = VPE
Mr. Wilder did introduce such legislation 17 years ago, but he did so at the request of a constituent, a common legislative technique used by lawmakers.

But maintaining U.S. influence will be difficult in the face of Japanese dominance in the region. Japan not only outstrips the U.S. in investment flows but also outranks it in trade with most Southeast Asian countries ( although the U.S. remains the leading trade partner for all of Asia ). Moreover, the Japanese government, now the world's largest aid donor, is pumping far more assistance into the region than the U.S. is. While U.S. officials voice optimism about Japan's enlarged role in Asia, they also convey an undertone of caution. "There's an understanding on the part of the U.S. that Japan has to expand its functions " in Asia, says J. Michael Farren, undersecretary of commerce for trade. " they approach it with a benevolent, altruistic attitude, there will be a net gain for everyone."  = VPE

That explains why the number of these wines is expanding so rapidly. But consumers who buy at this level are also more knowledgeable than they were a few years ago. "They won't buy if the quality is not there," said Cedric Martin of Martin Wine Cellar in New Orleans. " if they feel the wine is overpriced and they can get something equally good for less." Mr. Martin has increased prices on some wines ( like Grgich Hills Chardonnay, now $ 32 ) just to slow down movement, but he is beginning to see some resistance to high-priced red Burgundies and Cabernets and Chardonnays in the $ 30 to $ 40 range.  = VPE

The program-trading issue is heating up on Capitol Hill as it is on Wall Street, and several legislators want to grant the SEC the power to shut off the programs when trading becomes too volatile.

He also is a consensus manager, insiders say. The decision to make the bid for Nekoosa, for example, was made only after all six members of Georgia-Pacific's management committee signed onto the deal -- even though Mr. Hahn knew he wanted to go after the company early on, says Mr. Correll. Associates say Mr. Hahn picked up that careful approach to management as president of Virginia Polytechnic Institute. Assuming that post at the age of 35, he managed by consensus, as is the rule in universities, says Warren H. Strother, a university official who is researching a book on Mr. Hahn. But he also showed a willingness to take a strong stand. In 1970, Mr. Hahn called in state police to arrest student protesters who were occupying a university building.  = VPE
The framers hardly discussed the appropriations clause at the Constitutional Convention of 1787, according to Madison's notes. To the extent they did, their concern was to ensure fiscal accountability. Moreover, the framers believed that the nation needed a unitary executive with the independence and resources to perform the executive functions that the Confederation Congress had performed poorly under the Articles of Confederation. It would contradict that objective if the appropriations clause ( technically a limitation on legislative power ) could be read as placing the president on Congress's short leash, making the executive consist of the president and every member of Congress.  = VPE
President Bush should veto appropriations acts that contain these kinds of unconstitutional conditions on the president's ability to discharge his duties and exercise his prerogatives. If President Bush fails to do so in his first year, he will invite Congress, for the remainder of his presidency, to rewrite Article II of the Constitution to suit its purposes. What becomes custom in the Bush administration will only become more difficult for future presidents, including Democrats, to undo.  = VPE
If President Bush loses at the court, it might be disappointing, as Morrison v. Olson was for the Reagan administration. But the presidency would be no worse off than it is now.

As it stands now, Congress presumes after the Reagan administration that the White House will take unconstitutional provisions in appropriations bills lying down.

Department economists don't expect 1989 to be as good a year as 1988 was. Indeed, net cash income is likely to fall this year as farm expenses rise and government payments to farmers decline. At the same time, an increase of land under cultivation after the drought has boosted production of corn, soybeans and other commodities, causing a fall in prices that has been only partly cushioned by heavy grain buying by the Soviets.  = VPE
The Herald joins the Baltimore News-American, which folded, and the Boston Herald-American, which was sold, as cornerstones of the old Hearst newspaper empire abandoned by the company in the 1980s.

In point of fact, volatility as measured by the annualized standard deviation of daily stock price movements has frequently been much higher than it is today. Periods before the advent of futures or program trading were often more volatile, usually when fundamental market conditions were undergoing change ( 1973-75, 1937-40, and 1928-33 for example ). It is interesting to see the fundamental stock pickers scream "foul " on program trading when the markets decline, while hailing the great values still abounding as the markets rise. Could rising volatility possibly be related to uncertainty about the economics of stocks, instead of the evil deeds of program-trading goblins ?  = VPE

Many investors wrote asking the SEC to require insiders to report their purchases and sales immediately, not a month later. But Mr. Lane said that while the SEC regulates who files, the law tells them when to do so. Investors who want to change the required timing should write their representatives in Congress, he added. The SEC would likely be amenable to legislation that required insiders to file transactions on a more timely basis, he said.  = VPE

No wonder. We were coming down straight into their canal. See, the other rule of thumb about ballooning is that you can't steer. And neither can your pilot. You can go only up or down ( by heating the balloon's air with a propane burner, which does make the top of your head feel hot ) and ride the air currents. Which makes the chase car necessary. Most balloonists seldom go higher than2,000 feet and most average a leisurely 5-10 miles an hour. When the balloon is cruising along at a steady altitude there is little sense of motion. Only when one is ascending -- or in our case descending a tad trop rapidement -- does one feel, well, airborne in a picnic basket.  = VPE

I was pleased to note that your Oct. 23 Centennial Journal item recognized the money-fund concept as one of the significant events of the past century.

But the Reserve Fund, America's first money fund, was not named, nor were the creators of the money-fund concept, Harry Brown and myself.

These securities are attractive to Japanese investors for three reasons. First, they are safe. While they aren't backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, as Treasury bonds are, it is widely assumed that the government would support them if necessary. ( U.S. Treasury bonds are still the dollar-denominated investment of choice for long-term Japanese investors ). Second, they are liquid. The secondary market in federally backed mortgage securities now exceeds $ 900 billion, or nearly half of the $ 2.2 trillion in U.S. residential mortgages issued. Third, they offer high yields. At the moment, some offer as much as 1.6 to 1.8 percentage points over Treasury securities of similar maturities.  = VPE
In addition, further packaging of mortgage-backed securities, such as Blackstone's fund, have reduced the effects of prepayment risk and automatically reinvest monthly payments so institutions don't have to. Freddie Mac for years has offered a so-called participation certificate that guarantees it won't be prepaid for a set number of years and offers semiannual payments.  = VPE

Mr. Moon planned to convert millions of Americans to his unique brand of Christianity -- in which he plays the role of Old Testament-style temporal, political messiah -- and then to make the U.S. part of a unified international theocracy. His original strategy ( in itself a brilliant innovation for spreading a religion ) was to create new economic enterprises each time he wanted to extend and fund his various religious missions. Tax-exempt airport and street-corner solicitations were intended only to provide start-up funds. More stable industries were to build an economically viable infrastructure for the Moon movement in North America, as they had in Japan and South Korea.

Finally, I think it important to point out the extraordinarily high visibility of non-violent civil disobedience in these days of intensive media coverage. Give television a chance to cover live any breaking of the law, and no second invitation will be required. This brings into question the motives of those who lead civil disobedience demonstrations. Do they want the spotlight for themselves or for their cause ? Here is a good rule of thumb : If the movement produced the leader, the chance that he is sincere is much greater than if the leader produced the movement. In either case, ask yourself whether you have become better informed on the issues under protest by watching the act of civil disobedience. If you have not, it is probable that a thorough airing of the dispute by calm and rational debate would have been the better course.  = VPE

First, addressing the Oct. 13 market break, this was certainly more of a technical gyration and a local jungle exercise, than an investor reaction to the day's political events in Washington. Look not to the managers of taxable investment funds as the source of selling late that afternoon, but rather to several of the usual suspects ( " " banks and institutions ) geared up with imperfect trading programs that accelerate market deterioration, once begun.

The closeness of Soviet perestroika to the fascist social blueprint of Mussolini was evident when Mr. Gorbachev presented his economic vision to the Soviet Congress. In doing so, he neither rejected a socialist planned economy nor embraced the free market. Instead, he proposed a "law-governed economy," in which there would be a "clear-cut division between state direction of the economy and economic management."

But the Americans are also to blame. They long made little effort here. IBM, though long a leader in the Japanese mainframe business, didn't introduce its first PC in Japan until five years after NEC did, and that wasn't compatible even with the U.S. IBM standard. Apple didn't introduce a kanji machine -- one that handles the Chinese characters of written Japanese -- until three years after entering the market. Critics also say American companies charge too much. Japan's FTC says it is investigating Apple for allegedly discouraging retailers from discounting.  = VPE
Supporters of index arbitrage haven't been publicly sticking up for the trading strategy, as some did during the post-crash outcry of 1987. But Merrill Lynch, in its statement about pulling out of index arbitrage, suggested that the current debate has missed the mark.  = VPE
"Due to the earthquake in San Francisco, Nissan is donating its commercial air time to broadcast American Red Cross Emergency Relief messages. Please contribute what you can," the ad said. The Nissan logo flashed on the screen for a moment, and then came a taped plea for donations from former President Reagan -- followed by the silent print telling viewers where to call. Within two hours, viewers pledged over $400,000, according to a Red Cross executive.  = VPE
Toyota's upscale Lexus division, a sponsor of the World Series, also put in a plug for Red Cross donations in a World Series game it sponsored. "The World Series is brought to you by Lexus, who urges you to help relieve the suffering caused by the recent earthquake...," the game announcer said. And New York Life made a plea for Red Cross donations in newspaper ads in the San Francisco area, latching onto the coattails of the Red Cross's impeccable reputation : "The Red Cross has been helping people for 125 years. New York Life has been doing the same for over 140 years."  = VPE
Yesterday, Joel Zweibel, an attorney for Eastern's creditors committee, declined to comment on whether the experts had ever been instructed to look at other choices and whether they now were asked not to.

But even that group knows some people don't use their machines as much as they should. "The first excuse is they don't have enough time," says research director Thomas Doyle.

Or, at least, its heart disease.  = VPE
Some business analysts blame the problem on tough competition in the insurance market. They say insurance companies use policies aimed at excluding bad risks because their competitors do.

Industry executives and analysts are divided on whether Mr. Phillips is up to the task. He isn't as well-known to clients as is Mr. Roman. Under his watch, office politicking was often rampant in the agency's New York operation and the office there has had a dismal new-business record for more than a year.

And to protect their reduced capital investment from eroding further, market makers became quicker to lower price quotes when sell programs are in progress. On days when prices are tumbling, they must be willing to buy shares from sellers when no one else will. In such an environment, market makers can suffer huge losses both on trades made that day at steadily dropping prices and in the value of their inventories of shares.  = VPE

The Brookings and Urban Institute authors caution, however, that most nursing home stays are of comparatively short duration, and reaching the Medicaid level is more likely with an unusually long stay or repeated stays. Moreover, they note, those who manage to pay their own way often do so only by selling their homes, using up life savings or drawing heavily on children and other relatives.  = VPE
But as astounding as the changes that have already occurred are, there is a fragility to glasnost. Censorship isn't a Marxist invention. The czars were no civil libertarians. As late as the 1890s, the Russian government prevented any coverage of famines. It even directed newspapers not to publish anything that might stain the honor of the Turkish sultan's wives. So glasnost is not a value woven with steel threads into the fabric of Russian society. It is an admirable public relations program initiated by a single political leader during a four-year blink of history. It is public relations of the highest sophistication, that recognizes that credibility is enhanced by honesty -- up to a point.  = VPE
Judge Albert Green, in Cook County Circuit Court in Chicago, also recognized the suit, filed last May by Robert and Cynthia Langendorf, as a class action covering thousands of Irving customers.

The marriage of news and theater, if not exactly inevitable, has been consummated nonetheless. News programs, particularly if they score well in the ratings, appeal to the networks' cost-conscious corporate parents because they are so much less expensive to produce than an entertainment show is -- somewhere between $400,000 and $500,000 for a one-hour program. Entertainment shows tend to cost twice that. Re-enactments have been used successfully for several seasons on such syndicated "tabloid TV " shows as "A Current Affair," which is produced by the Fox Broadcasting Co. unit of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. That show, whose host is Ms. Chung's husband, Maury Povich, has a particular penchant for grisly murders and stories having to do with sex -- the Robert Chambers murder case, the Rob Lowe tapes, what have you.  = VPE
Although acquiring a foreign company would expand Japanese advertising agencies' business to foreign clients, many clients would also be Japanese companies expanding overseas, says the Dentsu spokesman.

Accepted theories of asset pricing offer a perfectly legitimate explanation. Accepted theories state that investors require higher returns on riskier investments. Thus, rather than seeing the excess returns to the pro-selected portfolio as being abnormal, I see those returns as simply compensations for taking on added risk. I believe the risk for each individual stock selected by your pros is very large. If you asked me to select a stock with the highest expected return, I would select a stock with the greatest amount of undiversifiable risk, as I am sure your pros do. Your hypothetical investor is simply being compensated for taking on this added risk.  = VPE

No doubt, Mr. Dinkins has been a calming influence. He is an avuncular figure who remembers the birthdays of colleagues' children, opens doors for women, and almost never has a bad word to say about anybody. More important, he emerged as a peacemaker last summer after the Central Park rape of a white jogger -- in which a group of Harlem teens was charged -- and the racial murder of a black teen-ager in the white Brooklyn neighborhood of Bensonhurst. Rather than scaring off white voters, as many predicted he would, Mr. Dinkins attracted many whites precisely because of his reputation for having a cool head.

As a critique of middle-class mores, the story is heavy-handed. But its unsentimental sketches of Cairo life are vintage Mahfouz. We see, smell and hear slums filled with "the echoes of hawkers advertising their wares interspersed with abusive language, rattling coughs and the sound of people gathering spittle in their throats and spewing into the street." And we meet engaging crooks, such as Hassan "the Head," famed for his head-butting fights, his whoring and his hashish. "God has not yet ordained that I should have earnings,' he tells his worried mother." Hassan comes to a bad end, but so does almost everyone else in the book.  = VPE
Said's story reflects the souring of socialism under Nasser, whose dictatorial rule replaced the monarchy overthrown in 1952. By 1961, Mr. Mahfouz's idealism had vanished or become twisted, as it has in Said.

Cairo's spirited squalor also has gone gray. Here, the city is dark and laden with symbolism : Said has left his jail cell only to enter the larger prison of Cairo society.

Finally, the case of Dr. Morgan gave Congress an opportunity to act with unaccustomed decisiveness and to engage in one of its favorite pastimes -- bashing the District of Columbia government.

The idea of a child-as-required-yuppie-possession must be motivating them, since the wealthy offspring of their friends are shown to be rude brats, in therapy by age five.  = VPE

The Soviet Union should keep these lessons in mind as it seeks to establish the ruble as an international currency. One way to make the ruble into a major international currency would be to leave reserves of gold and earning assets in a Swiss bank with distributions based on Swiss laws. Unless the laws determining the noteholder's rights to payment are independent of the issuer of those notes, however, a gold-based ruble would be as unsuccessful for the Soviets as it was for the czars.

The junk-mail titans, ever optimistic, are looking for ways around the problem. So far, they say, it hasn't had any noticeable effect on response rates. And before it does, they're trying to cut back on the clutter that created the situation in the first place. Among other things, the industry is trying to come up with standardized business lists that cut down on duplications. "We're going to have to mail a lot less and a lot smarter," says Jack Miller, president of Quill Corp., a Lincolnshire, Ill., business-to-business mail-order company. But then again, mailing less and smarter won't be much help if the mail ends up in the garbage anyway.  = VPE
In 1986, some institute patients were reporting breakthrough seizures when they were switched from a specific brand-name medication to a generic one or from one generic manufacturer of a specific product to another. In addition, neurologists were beginning to report these observations as well. Call it anecdotal if you will. But no ethical physician would switch patients who were doing well on a specific medication from a specific manufacturer to prove a point.  = VPE
"Traffic is certainly a concern, as is pollution, water and an adequate labor market," says Frank Sain, executive director of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Bureau. City fathers have managed to push through projects that are crucial for tourist growth, such as the expansion of McCarran International Airport to accommodate the 44 % of Las Vegas tourists who fly here. This year, by one means of transport or another, more than 18 million people will visit the city.  = VPE
Will the investments pay off ? The growth of Las Vegas tourism in recent years persuades lenders that they will. Casino revenues and hotel occupancy rates are high. Last year, the tourists left $ 3 billion with the area's casinos, nearly 10 % more than in 1987. The people with a stake in Nevada's gambling industry believe that they have barely tapped the potentially huge family trade.  = VPE
There are few mementos of his days as White House deputy chief of staff and confidant of Ronald and Nancy Reagan.

The Morgan case thus tells us much more about the current state of sex, class, race and politics in our society than it does about the facts of Dr. Morgan's particular situation.

The Bank of England, on the other hand, had gold reserves that averaged about 30 % of its outstanding currency, and Bank of England notes were accepted throughout the world. The most likely reason for this disparity is that the Bank of England was a private bank with substantial earning assets, and the common-law rights of creditors to collect claims against the bank were well established in Britain. By contrast, in 19th-century Russia an authoritarian government owned the bank and had the power to revoke payment whenever it chose, much as it would in today's Soviet Union.  = VPE
Morgan Stanley and Kidder Peabody, the two biggest program trading firms, staunchly defend their strategies. "We continue to believe the position we've taken is reasonable," a Morgan Stanley official said. "We would stop index arbitrage when the market is under stress, and we have recently," he said, citing Oct. 13 and earlier this week.

The burning question is whether the new chief can parry Mr. Icahn without being pushed into unwelcome moves. Mr. Corry might have to dismember the company more than he wants to. Or he might have to incur a huge expense of either buying Mr. Icahn's stock, possibly at a premium, or paying stockholders a special dividend partly because of Mr. Icahn's pressure.  = VPE
With his recent purchases of USX common stock, Mr. Icahn shattered a three-year-old, unwritten standstill agreement with Mr. Roderick. In 1986, Mr. Roderick adroitly dodged Mr. Icahn's first bullet after the takeover specialist had built up an 11.4 % stake. Mr. Roderick did so by having USX redeem a series of guaranteed notes, a move that, in effect, raised the cost of a $ 7.19 billion Icahn bid by about $ 3 billion. And he managed to fend off further advances and even strike up an unlikely friendship with the interloper. Over dinners at New York's Sky Club and Links Club restaurants, the steel executive and the big investor talked steel, international trade and thoroughbred horses.  = VPE
The 57-year-old tax attorney never even aspired to the job of chief executive. An undistinguished college student who dabbled in zoology until he concluded that he couldn't stand cutting up frogs, Mr. Corry wanted to work for a big company "that could do big things." But after joining the tax department of a USX subsidiary 30 years ago, he set the modest goal of becoming tax manager by the age of 46. For years, he quietly stuck to the back accounting rooms, wearing a hat to work because everyone else did. "I was never a rebel," he said in an earlier interview. "I don't think most of the people that have been around me would ever say they've seen me pound the table or get angry."  = VPE

A Japanese apple called the Fuji is cropping up in orchards the way Hondas did on U.S. roads. By 1995 it will be planted more often than any other apple tree, according to a recent survey of six apple-industry sages by Washington State University horticulturist Robert Norton. Some fruit visionaries say the Fuji could someday tumble the Red Delicious from the top of America's apple heap.  = VPE
Mr. Auvil, razor sharp at 83, has picked and packed a zillion pecks of apples over the past 65 years. He is known as the father of the U.S.-grown Granny Smith, a radically different apple that the conventional wisdom once said would never catch on. It did, shaking the apple establishment to its roots. Now, even more radical changes seem afoot as the grand old maverick of American apples plays the role of Hiroshi Appleseed. "The Fuji is going to be No. 1 to replace the Red Delicious," he says.  = VPE
Supermarkets are getting into the variety act, too. They still buy apples mainly for big, red good looks -- that's why so many taste like woodchucks' punching bags. But freshness counts more than it once did, and stores are expanding shelf space for unconventional, but tastier, and often pricier, apples. " than sell 39-cents-a-pound Delicious, maybe we can sell 79-cents-a-pound Fujis," says Chuck Tryon, perishables director for Super Valu Inc., a Minneapolis supermarket chain and food distributor.  = VPE
Instead of proposing a complete elimination of farm subsidies, as the earlier U.S. proposal did, the new package calls for the elimination of only the most tradedistorting ones.

The new goal of the Voting Rights Act -- more minorities in political office -- is laudable. For the political process to work, all citizens, regardless of race, must feel represented. One essential indicator that they are is that members of minority groups get elected to public office with reasonable frequency.

It is a quick fix for a complex problem.  = VPE
By not choosing one of these options, Israelis will condemn themselves, as the Maronites did, to perpetual war with the Muslims in their midst, and so to the internal erosion of their state.

But that is not much of a consolation to draw from the failure of General Aoun.  = VPE
The volatility inherent in program trading troubled other traders, too. They don't like the risks they are forced to assume when prices swing so drastically. Market makers are supposed to keep supplies of stocks on hand to maintain orderly trading when imbalances occur. That means that on days when prices are tumbling and sellers abound they must be willing to buy shares from sellers when no one else will. In such an environment, a market maker can absorb huge losses.  = VPE

Poland's 2.7 million small private farms cover 76 % of its arable land. On it, a quarter of the country's 39 million people produce three-quarters of its grain, beef, eggs and milk, and nine-tenths of its fruit, vegetables and potatoes. Like the Roman Catholic Church, the Polish peasant is a pillar of the nation. Try as they might, the Communists could neither replace nor break him. And they did try.  = VPE
The state quit shoving peasants onto its subsidized farms over 30 years ago. But it never did let up on the pressure. Until recently, a farmer with no heir had to will the state his land to collect his pension. The pension's size still depends on how much produce he sells the state. His allotment of materials also did, until the state couldn't hold up its end of that bargain. Yet the state alone sells seeds and machines. When supplies are short, it often hands them over only in exchange for milk or grain.  = VPE
The stock market's precipitous drop frightened foreign investors, who quickly bid the dollar lower. But as stock prices recovered some of the early losses, so did the U.S. currency. Although dealers said investors are becoming more bearish toward the dollar in the wake of the stock market's recent troubles and as the U.S. economy weakens, the dollar ended down only modestly.  = VPE
Given the prelude's thematic connections with the music preceding the last act, the idea is more worn than bad, though as luck would have it, for a change there actually was a conductor in the pit whom we wanted to hear, Carlos Kleiber, trying to make memorable music while we all waited for the bed lump to stir into song.

Despite their ubiquity, the consultants aren't entirely welcome. Some lawyers and scholars see the social scientists' vision of the American jury system as a far cry from the ideal presented in civics texts and memorialized on the movie screen. In the film classic "Twelve Angry Men," the crucible of deliberations unmasks each juror's bias and purges it from playing a role in the verdict. After hours of conflict and debate, that jury focuses on the facts with near-perfect objectivity. In real life, jurors may not always work that way, but some court observers question why they shouldn't be encouraged to do so rather than be programmed not to.  = VPE

That's a lot of banishment, as it turns out.

But it is unfair to dump on teachers, as distinct from the educational establishment. I know many schoolteachers and, on the whole, they are seriously committed to conscientious teaching. They may not be among the "best and brightest " of their generation -- there are very few such people, by definition. But they need not be to do their jobs well. Yes, we all can remember one or two truly inspiring teachers from our school days. But our education proceeded at the hands of those others, who were merely competent and conscientious. In this sense, a teacher can be compared to one's family doctor. If he were brilliant, he probably would not be a family doctor in the first place.

The suites are air-conditioned, have wet bars and plush seating, and offer a clear view of the field -- all for a sale price of $475,000 to $ 1 million, depending on their size and location. Mr. Jones has been taking prospective suite owners onto the field during practice to let them rub elbows with players, and promises those who actually buy one of the rooms an insider's look at the team's strategy before game time. The sales job seems to be paying off : When he bought the team, only six of the suites had been sold. Today, 30 have.  = VPE

That would give the Pentagon flexibility that no other federal agency has. "It's simply a way of making the cuts less onerous for defense than they are for domestic programs," said Chairman James Sasser ( D., Tenn. ) of the Senate Budget Committee, who said he would oppose the request. "That isn't consistent with the kind of discipline that Gramm-Rudman is supposed to impose," he said.  = VPE

Out on the streets, some residents of badly damaged buildings were allowed a 15-minute scavenger hunt through their possessions. "It's so weird to have to decide what's really important to you," said Barbara May. She went first for personal mementos. In post-earthquake parlance, her building is a "red." After being inspected, buildings with substantial damage were color-coded. Green allowed residents to re-enter ; yellow allowed limited access ; red allowed residents one last entry to gather everything they could within 15 minutes.  = VPE
Three International Cash Portfolios funds, which invest almost exclusively in bonds and money-market instruments overseas, were among the four top-performing funds in the latest week. Because the funds' investments are denominated in foreign currencies, their value expressed in dollars goes up when those currencies rise against the dollar. But when the dollar rises against major foreign currencies, as it did for much of this year, the dollar value of these funds declines. All three funds posted negative returns for the year to date.  = VPE

The new technologies are intended to retire the cathode-ray tube, which accounts for most of the bulk of the conventional TV set. Replacing the cathode-ray tube with a large, thin screen is the key to the creation of a high-definition television, or HDTV, which is expected to become a $ 30 billion business world-wide within a decade. Large U.S. companies are interested in other segments of the HDTV business, such as signal-processing and broadcast equipment. But except for Zenith Electronics Corp. and International Business Machines Corp., which is collaborating with Toshiba on computer displays, they are poorly positioned to exploit advances in large panels. General Electric Co. recently sold off its interests in liquid-crystal displays to Thompson-CSF of France. "We found the market not developing as we thought it would," a GE spokesman says.  = VPE
Thus far, almost all of the basic technology relating to high-definition television has come from U.S. laboratories.

And they will again, say money-manager proponents of the growth-stock theme. Cabanne Smith, president of a money management company bearing his name, predicts that investment companies using computers to identify companies with earnings "momentum " will climb on the growth-stock bandwagon as the overall corporate earnings outlook deteriorates further. He also thinks foreign investors, who are showing signs of more discriminate investing, will join the pursuit and pump up prices.  = VPE

We badly need to follow fact rather than the rhetoric of conventional wisdom. Without this basic level of attention to reality, our policies on Cuba will continue to be as counterproductive as they have for 30 years.

There is no rational justification for such behavior.  = VPE
What this all means in shorthand is that Soviet dominance in Ethiopia is collapsing as fast as President Barre's regime in Somalia is.

But while history can suggest what is reasonable to expect there's no guarantee that the past will repeat itself.

With this personal strategy firmly in place, I look forward to years of fine life-style investments and increasing widespread leverage. My kids' college education looms as perhaps the greatest future opportunity for spending, although I'll probably have to cash in their toy portfolio to take advantage of it. But with every step I take, I'm building wealth. You can, too, if you, like me, refuse to bite the bullet. So go out there and eat that debt. You're right there in the mainstream of American business, building value on the back of insupportable expenditures. Henry Kravis, watch out !  = VPE
So do just about all the losses that could be attributed to the sheer incompetence of unqualified planners. Nobody can estimate the toll, but John Gargan, a Tampa, Fla., planner and head of one trade group, the International Association of Registered Financial Planners, thinks the danger to investors from incompetence is "humongous," far greater than that from crookery. His group, like others, wants minimum standards applied to all who call themselves financial planners.  = VPE
Other cases go to show that an old saw still applies : If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Certificates of deposit don't pay 23 % a year, for example, but that didn't give pause to clients of one Alabama planner. Now they're losers and he's in jail in Mobile County. CDs yielding 40 % are even more implausible -- especially when the issuing "bank " in the Marshall Islands is merely a mail drop watched over by a local gas-station operator -- but investors fell for that one too.  = VPE
It never hurt anyone, that is, unless the growth funds don't grow when you need them to. Or the zero-coupon bonds turn out not to have been discounted deeply enough to pay your kid's tuition. That's the dilemma for today's parent. Although many experts are advising risk, no one has a good answer for you if the risk doesn't pay off.  = VPE
The issue here may be the soundness of the guarantee. Prepayments, much like mutual-fund purchases, are pooled for investment. Sponsors are naturally counting on their ability to keep ahead of tuition inflation with investment returns. But buyers are essentially betting on a start-up investment fund with no track record -- and some have been encouraged to borrow to do so.  = VPE
The number of misclassified workers may be in the millions, mostly paid by small firms.

Revenue-short states also are becoming more aggressive pursuers of tax delinquents, and perhaps none tracks them down with more relish than does New York since it acquired an $ 80 million computer system in 1985. The state's tax enforcers have amassed data bases from other New York agencies that license or register professionals and businesses ; from exchange agreements with the IRS, 24 other states, and two Canadian provinces, and even from phonebook Yellow Pages. Thus armed for massive matching of documents by computer, they single out high-income groups, looking primarily for people who haven't filed New York income-tax returns.  = VPE

Traditional no-loads made their money by charging an annual management fee, usually a modest one ; they imposed no other fees, and many still don't. In recent years, though, a passel of others flying the no-load flag have been imposing hefty charges -- all the way up to 6 % -- when an investor sells his shares.

Mr. Daly in his affidavit acknowledges that Warner agreed to release the producers last year to take over MGM but says that situation was altogether different. For one thing, according to Mr. Daly, the producers requested a release in advance.

Warner itself was in negotiations with MGM over certain movie and other rights, and it was " Warner's interest to accommodate MGM\, Guber and Peters by permitting them to become MGM executives," Mr. Daly said in his affidavit.  = VPE

The individual foreign policy carried out by U.S. legislators adds to a confusing U.S. performance that has emboldened Soviet initiatives in Central America. On Oct. 3, following conversations with Secretary of State James Baker, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze arrived in Managua to acclaim "Nicaragua's great peace efforts." There, Mr. Shevardnadze felt legitimized to unveil his own peace plan : The U.S.S.R. would prolong a suspension of arms shipments to Nicaragua after the February election if the U.S. did likewise with its allies in Central America. He also called on Nicaragua's neighbors to accept a "military equilibrium " guaranteed by both superpowers.

While this theory is exceedingly simple, it appears to explain several things. First, why ticket splitting has increased and taken the peculiar pattern that it has over the past half century : Prior to the election of Franklin Roosevelt as president and the advent of the New Deal, government occupied a much smaller role in society and the prisoner's dilemma problem confronting voters in races for Congress was considerably less severe.  = VPE

Today a President can still send up spending rescissions, but they're meaningless unless Congress has a guilty conscience and changes its mind. This is like asking foxes to feel remorse about chickens, and naturally rescissions are almost never approved. In 1987, President Reagan sent 73 rescissions back to the Hill, but only 3 % of the spending total was approved by Congress. Senator Coats's proposal would let the proposed spending cuts take place automatically unless Congress acts. The Members could still try to serve their constituents with special-interest goodies, but the police ( in the form of a President ) would be there with a straitjacket if they really get crazy, as they do now.  = VPE
A program called Notes, which is under development by Lotus, also is designed to sort E-mail sent within work groups.

Mr. Peters, on the other hand, has fewer fans in Hollywood, and his detractors like to characterize him as something of a hot-tempered bully.

As we know, voters tend to favor Republicans more in races for president than in those for Congress. In every presidential election over the past half century, except for the Goldwater presidential candidacy, the GOP has captured a greater percentage of the major-party popular vote for president than it has of congressional seats or the popular vote for Congress. Prior to 1932, the pattern was nearly the opposite.  = VPE
Is there any empirical support for this theory ? Three pieces of evidence corroborate the key assumption that Democratic legislators are more willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Republican colleagues. First, economists James Bennett and Thomas DiLorenzo find that GOP senators turn back roughly 10 % more of their allocated personal staff budgets than Democrats do. To the extent that the primary duty of personal staff involves local benefit-seeking, this indicates that political philosophy leads congressional Republicans to pay less attention to narrow constituent concerns.  = VPE
Second, if the key assumption is valid, Democrats should have lower attendance rates on roll-call votes than Republicans do to the extent that such votes reflect national policy making and that participating in such votes takes away from the time a legislator could otherwise devote to local benefit-seeking. This is indeed what the data indicate, particularly in the case of the House. The Democratic House attendance rate has not exceeded the Republican House attendance rate since 1959.  = VPE
Moreover, ticket splitting appears to take the same peculiar pattern at the state government level as it does at the federal level. State government is more typically split along Republican-governor\ lines than the reverse. A cross-state econometric investigation, furthermore, reveals that, holding other factors constant, the difference between a state's major-party vote going to the Republican gubernatorial candidate and the Republican share of the lower state house is a positive function of the state tax rate.  = VPE

Sassy already has recovered ; circulation has quickly passed the500,000 mark and advertising pages have stabilized this year at more than 300. What's more, Mr. Lang says he has what all publishers wish for : a bona fide niche. "Seventeen is written more for mothers, not their daughters," said Mr. Lang. " Sassy has a different spirit. It gets more mail in a month than McCall's got in a year, and it's not from mothers. I feel about Sassy like I did about Working Woman 10 years ago." Mr. Lang took on Ms. and Sassy with the acquisition of Matilda Publications Inc. by his newly formed Lang Communications.

The problem is one that East Germany shares with other half-states, such as North Korea, but one it must shoulder alone in the East Bloc. When Poland moves to reform, it can at least lean on its past : However flawed and short-lived Joseph Pilsudski's interwar republic, it was a nonsocialist democracy. Czech reformers can recall the Wilsonian ideals of the same period in their country. Even the Soviet Union has Peter the Great to rediscover, should it choose to. But East Germany is merely "the land of truly existing socialism." Beyond that, it has to compete with West Germany for a claim to the German identity. Up to now, the main weapon of the "worker and peasant state " has been the ideology of socialism.  = VPE
SUGAR : Futures prices extended Tuesday's gains. The March delivery ended with an advance of 0.16 cent a pound to 14.27 cents, for a two-day gain of 0.3 cent. According to one dealer, Japan said it has only40,000 tons of sugar remaining to be shipped to it this year by Cuba under current commitments. The announcement was made because of reports Tuesday that Cuba would delay shipments to Japan scheduled for later this year, into early next year. The dealer said the quantity mentioned in the Japanese announcement is so small that it's meaningless. One analyst said he thought the market continued to be supported to some degree by a delay in the Cuban sugar harvest caused by adverse weather. The dealer said India might be the real factor that is keeping futures prices firm. That country recently bought200,000 tons of sugar and had been expected to seek a like quantity last week but didn't. "It's known they need the sugar, and the expectation that they will come in is apparently giving the market its principal support," the dealer said.  = VPE

Some American officers interpreted his eagerness and studiousness as a sign of loyalty, but they did so falsely. He rose to chief of intelligence in Panama's socalled G-2 in 1970 after providing populist dictator Torrijos the critical support to defeat a coup attempt against him a year earlier. He became Gen. Torrijos's inseparable shadow, and the holder of all Panama's secrets. Mr. Noriega, by now a lieutenant colonel, expanded his contacts to include the Cubans -- not to mention the Israelis, the Taiwanese and any other intelligence service that came knocking.

With the February 1987 U.N. accords " to Afghanistan," the Soviet Union got everything it needed to consolidate permanent control. The terms of the Geneva accords leave Moscow free to provide its clients in Kabul with assistance of any kind -- including the return of Soviet ground forces -- while requiring the U.S. and Pakistan to cut off aid. The only fly in the Soviet ointment was the last-minute addition of a unilateral American caveat, that U.S. aid to the resistance would continue as long as Soviet aid to Kabul did. But as soon as the accords were signed, American officials sharply reduced aid. In February 1989, when the Soviets said they had completed their pullout, the U.S. cut it further.  = VPE

Despite his racial advantage, to be a great butler is a heroic calling ; one's pantry is " unlike general's headquarters during a battle." If, for example, in the midst of a great social occasion ( such as an international conference on revising the Versailles Treaty in 1923 ), one's 72-yearold father, himself a great butler once, should happen to die of a stroke, one must continue to serve the port : " don't think me unduly improper in not ascending to see my father in his deceased condition just at this moment. You see, I know my father would have wished me to carry on just now." It is this kind of dignity and restraint that allows Stevens to declare : " all its sad associations, whenever I recall that evening today, I find I do so with a large sense of triumph."

Then, to make matters worse, computerized sell programs kicked in, hammering stocks into steeper losses. There was heavy stock-index arbitrage, as traders sold big baskets of stock and bought stock-index futures to profit from the price discrepancies between the two markets. This was a hangover from Friday, when Standard & Poor's 500-stock index futures had closed at a sharp discount to stocks. The onslaught of the program selling dashed any hopes that some of the big program trading firms would hold off until the market stabilized. They didn't.

Then at 10:15 the Dow suddenly started to rebound, and when it shot upward it did so even faster than the early-morning fall. And this time, it wasn't just the program traders who were responsible.

But according to one trader, the programmers "n't look as dominant on the upside as on the downside because there was { also } a lot of bargain-hunting " by institutions.  = VPE

Congress has been critical of the Bush administration for not sending enough aid to Poland, so it is getting ready to send its own version of a CARE package.

COPPER : Futures prices fell and showed little rebound as one major labor problem that had been underpinning prices appeared to be solved. The December contract declined 3.05 cents a pound to $ 1.2745. Prices were down from the outset of trading on concern that a drop in the stock market might create a weakened economy and a consequent reduction in copper use. But the recovery in the stock market provided little help for copper as word spread that a three-month strike at the Highland Valley mine in British Columbia was about over, according to an analyst. Highland Valley is a large Canadian producer and principal supplier to Japan, which recently began seeking copper elsewhere as its inventories shrank. Last week it was reported that company and union negotiations had overcome the major hurdle, the contracting out of work by the company. Now, the analyst said, only minor points remain to be cleaned up. " all intents and purposes, an agreement appears to have been achieved," he said. Copper inventories in New York's Commodity Exchange warehouses rose yesterday by 516 tons, to10,004 tons. London Metal Exchange copper inventories last week declined13,575 tons, to89,300 tons. The LME stocks decline was about as expected, but the Comex gain wasn't. However, this was brushed aside by concern over the stock market, the analyst said. At one point in futures trading, as the stock market firmed, the December contract rose to as high as $ 1.2965, but it wasn't able to sustain the gain. "It was simply overbought," he said, and selling by funds that are computer guided helped depress prices.  = VPE

Factory officials estimate that more than 10 % of the work force here is redundant, but layoffs aren't allowed. Even factory workers' children are guaranteed jobs. The industrial monoliths are so deeply involved in the welfare system that China's leaders may never be able to modernize them, despite their glaring economic inefficiency. Though the Panzhihua factory itself is profitable, many such enterprises aren't. Subsidies for money-losing enterprises totaled $ 18 billion last year, or about one-third the total state revenue.  = VPE
What keeps Mr. Li in Panzhihua ? Partly the system. While workers can't easily be fired, they also can't easily quit to find jobs elsewhere. The Li family could apply for permission to do so, but hasn't tried. "I expect I'll be in Panzhihua for the rest of my life," Mr. Li says. "The No. 1 high school is pretty good, and I have to think of my daughter's future."  = VPE
The Fed allowed the key federal funds interest rate to dip to about 8 5\ % from its levels of just below 9 % last week. That was a sign to financial markets that, at least for now, the Fed was easing its grip on credit. Because the markets remained relatively calm, however, the Fed didn't have to inject massive amounts of money into the banking system, as it did in October 1987.  = VPE
"I do not regard the amount of the decline on Friday as unexpected or unlikely," he said in a telephone interview. " the market being up to2,700 or2,800 and the existence of derivative products... one can expect volatility of the magnitude we had."  = VPE
Those sound like innocuous changes, but they're not. Both the Treasury and Congress traditionally have pushed for easy money, the Treasury to reduce its debt management problems and Congress to satisfy powerful producer constituencies who want a weak dollar for short-term competitive gains in world markets. Congressional pressures on the Fed similar to those that produced the savings and loan mess are an awful thought.  = VPE
Easy money advocates, however, are adept at spreading economic myths. There is the constant insistence that the Fed could lower interest rates were it not so obstinate. The Fed indeed can lower short-term interest rates by pumping reserves into the banks, but it can't do much about them from there on. If the reserves generate inflation, which is what the Fed fears most right now, interest rates will go up as lenders demand a premium. Enough inflation can ultimately even wipe out the bond market, as it did in Britain in the 1970s, thereby crippling the economy.  = VPE
These two myths have caused the republic untold damage. The U.S. economy took on an inflationary bias when the Fed was forced to finance an incredible spending spree by Lyndon Johnson. Richard Nixon exacerbated the problem when, in response to pressures from Congress, he applied price and wage controls in August 1971, thereby discouraging production. Jimmy Carter ultimately hired Mr. Volcker to kill inflation, which was reaching dangerous levels. He did, too late to save Mr. Carter from forced retirement.  = VPE
The claim that inflation generates economic growth is seductive. In fact it does the opposite. As the charts show, the 1975-80 inflation destroyed both productivity and economic growth ( see accompanying charts -- WSJ Oct. 17, 1989 ). It was only after Mr. Volcker killed inflation, at the cost of a sharp but brief recession, that growth and productivity started rising once more. Producers were forced by the discipline of sound money to slash away organizational fat and acquire more efficient equipment. After having performed that admirable feat, however, they were back in 1985 demanding a dollar devaluation that would make it still easier for them to compete in international markets. They got the devaluation and, as is usually the case, began picking up fat again. So now they want another one.  = VPE
Authorities, including the Bank of England and the Securities Association, are gearing up in case a crisis wallops the London market. The bank was in touch with other major central banks over the weekend and was preparing to make capital available to dealers if needed, as it did in the 1987 crash, according to people familiar with the bank's strategy.  = VPE
Many are quick to emphasize that just because the market can fall as fast as it did Friday doesn't mean it will tank again, despite some disquieting similarities between now and October 1987. As in 1987, this latest market slide was preceded by sparring between nations and government officials over the dollar.  = VPE
If foreigners dump U.S. stocks and return to the safety of their home markets -- as they did in October 1987 -- they must simultaneously also sell dollars for their own currencies. Those transactions, in turn, could weaken the dollar. Even if foreigners just withhold from buying additional U.S. securities, they reduce the demand for dollars.  = VPE
America West, though, is a smaller airline and therefore more affected by the delayed delivery of a single plane than many of its competitors would be. "I figure that American and United probably have such a hard time counting all the planes in their fleets, they might not miss one at all," Mr. Otradovec said.  = VPE
Major oil companies in the next few days are expected to report much less robust earnings than they did for the third quarter a year ago, largely reflecting deteriorating chemical prices and gasoline profitability. The gasoline picture may improve this quarter, but chemicals are likely to remain weak, industry executives and analysts say, reducing chances that profits could equal their year-earlier performance.  = VPE
But securities analysts say Phillips will be among the companies hard-hit by weak chemical prices and will probably post a drop in third-quarter earnings. So, too, many analysts predict, will Exxon Corp., Chevron Corp. and Amoco Corp.  = VPE
"It hasn't had any impact on us, nor do we expect it to," said a spokeswoman for Miller Brewing Co., a major client of Backer Spielvogel. John Lampe, director of advertising at PaineWebber Inc., a Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising client, said : "We have no problem with the announcement, because we don't know what change it's going to bring about. We aren't going to change agencies because of a change in London."  = VPE
The Bronx has a wonderful botanical garden, a great zoo, its own charming Little Italy ( on Arthur Avenue ) and, of course, the Yankees. However, most people, having been subjected to news footage of the devastated South Bronx, look at the borough the way Tom Wolfe's Sherman McCoy did in "Bonfire of the Vanities " -- as a wrong turn into hell.  = VPE
Then there's "The World Today," the prime-time newscast featuring Mr. Shaw and Ms. Crier. Until now, CNN has featured its Hollywood gossip show during the key evening period. But 70 % of the cable-television-equipped households that watch news do so between 6:30 p.m. and 7 p.m., the network discovered, so CNN wants in. Mr. Amos says the Shaw-Crier team will probably do two live interviews a day, with most of the program, at least for now, appearing similar to CNN's other newcasts.  = VPE
While some in the U.S. contend that advertising is the bane of television, here many believe that its absence is to blame for the European TV industry's sluggish development. Until recently, national governments in Europe controlled most of the air time and allowed little or no advertising. Since production costs were guaranteed, it didn't matter that a program couldn't be sold abroad or put into syndication, as most American programs are. But not much money was spent on the shows, either, a situation that encouraged cheap-to-make talk and game shows, while discouraging expensive-to-produce dramas.  = VPE
IOWA IS MAKING a comeback. So are Indiana, Ohio and Michigan. The population of all four states is on the upswing, according to new Census Bureau estimates, following declines throughout the early 1980s.  = VPE
If Mr. Mason had used less derogatory language to articulate his amateur analysis of the voting behavior of his fellow New Yorkers, would the water be quite so hot ? It probably would, because few or none of the people upset by Mr. Mason's remarks have bothered to distinguish between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used insulting language. In addition, some of Mr. Mason's critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of racism.  = VPE
Don't say the TV sitcom, because that happens to be a genre that, in its desperate need to attract everybody and offend nobody, resembles politics more than it does comedy. It is true that the best sitcoms do allow group differences to simmer : yuppies vs. blue-collar Bostonians in "Cheers " ; children vs. adults in "The Cosby Show." But these are not the differences that make headlines.  = VPE
In "Chicken Soup," Mr. Mason plays Jackie, a Jewish bachelor courting Maddie ( Lynn Redgrave ), an Irish widow and mother of three, against the wishes of his mother ( Rita Karin ) and her brother Michael ( Brandon Maggart ). It's worth noting that both disapproving relatives are immigrants. At least, they both speak with strong accents, as do Jackie and Maddie. It couldn't be more obvious that "Chicken Soup " is being made from an old recipe. And a safe one -- imagine if the romance in question were between an Orthodox Jew and a member of the Nation of Islam.  = VPE
Yes, he did. As I watched him on C-Span, I heard him speak those lovely words about the Bill of Rights, which he quotes from the transcript of the hearings. He did repeat those nice platitudes several times as an indication of his support for the Constitution. He used about 56 words defending the witnesses' constitutional rights.  = VPE
Market makers keep supplies of stock on hand to maintain orderly trading when imbalances occur. On days like Friday, that means they must buy shares from sellers when no one else is willing to. When selling is so frenzied, prices fall steeply and fast. Two years ago, faced with the possibility of heavy losses on the stocks in their inventories, market makers themselves began dumping shares, exacerbating the slide in OTC stock prices.  = VPE
"There are some very significant issues out there, such as the fiscal deficit, the trade deficit, our relations with Japan, that have to be the subject of major initiatives," he said in an interview. "I'd like to see that initiative, and I haven't. There isn't a big shot, an agenda."  = VPE
Surveys suggested that consumer confidence was high before Friday. A 190-point drop isn't likely to make much of a dent ; multiply that a few times over, though, and it will. If the reactions of executives gathered Saturday at Hot Springs, Va., for the Business Council meetings are typical, business leaders weren't overly rattled by Friday's decline. And if foreign investors become a tad more cautious -- well, the dollar's recent strength suggests that the U.S. can stand it.  = VPE
A rebound in energy prices, which helped push up the producer price index, is expected to do the same in the consumer price report. The consensus view expects a 0.4 % increase in the September CPI after a flat reading in August.  = VPE
Robert H. Chandross, an economist for Lloyd's Bank in New York, is among those expecting a more moderate gain in the CPI than in prices at the producer level. "Auto prices had a big effect in the PPI, and at the CPI level they won't," he said.  = VPE
While the network currently can operate freely in Budapest, so can others. In addition, competition for listeners is getting tougher in many ways than when broadcasting here was strictly controlled. Instead of being denounced as an evil agent of imperialism, Radio Free Europe is more likely to draw the criticism that its programs are too tame, even boring.  = VPE
What is one to think of all this ? Doctrine and special interests govern some responses. People eager to have youth " their dues to society " favor service proposals -- preferably mandatory ones. So do those who seek a "re-energized concept of citizenship," a concept imposing stern obligations as well as conferring rights. Then there are instinctive opponents. To libertarians, mandatory service is an abomination and voluntary systems are illegitimate uses of tax money. Devotees of the market question the value of the work national service would perform : If the market won't pay for it, they argue, it can't be worth its cost. Elements of the left are also reflexively opposed ; they see service as a cover for the draft, or fear the regimentation of youth, or want to see rights enlarged, not obligations.  = VPE
Good service programs require recruitment, screening, training and supervision -- all of high quality. They involve stipends to participants. Full-time residential programs also require housing and full-time supervision ; they are particularly expensive -- more per participant than a year at Stanford or Yale. Non-residential programs are cheaper, but good ones still come to some $10,000 a year. Are they worth that ? Evaluations suggest that good ones are -- especially so if the effects on participants are counted. But the calculations are challengeable.  = VPE
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was on the telephones, making it clear to officials in the U.S. and abroad that the Fed was prepared to inject massive amounts of money into the banking system, as it did in October 1987, if the action were needed to prevent a financial crisis.  = VPE
Sony found a new market niche, but Mr. Kaye figured that its prices left plenty of room for a lower-priced competitor. His products aren't exact copies of Sony's but strongly resemble them in size, shape and, especially, color. Sony uses mostly red and blue, with traces of yellow -- and so does Justin, on the theory that kids prefer these colors. ( " be successful, a product can be any color whatsoever, as long as it is fire-engine red," says Charles E. Baxley, Justin's attorney. )  = VPE
Now, dozens of corporations, including Ethan Allen, TW Services and York International, that are counting on at least $ 7 billion of scheduled new junk financings to keep their highly leveraged takeovers and buy-outs afloat, may never get the money. "The music has stopped playing," says Michael Harkins, a principal in the investment firm of Levy Harkins. "You've either got a chair or you don't."  = VPE
Ramada, which first delayed and then shelved a $ 400 million junk bond sale that was designed to help finance a restructuring, fell 15.6 % to close at 9 1\. Ramada has said it hopes to propose a new restructuring plan but hasn't indicated when it will do so.  = VPE
But the stock market as a whole, bolstered as it is by takeover speculation, remains vulnerable to any further pullback by takeover financiers, both in the junkbond market and among commercial banks. For debt-ridden suitors, "the takeover game has been over for some time," says New York money manager Neil Weisman of Chilmark Capital, who has been keeping 85 % of his portfolio in cash. "The market is just waking up to that point."  = VPE
Mr. Wertheimer said the Senate Ethics Committee should hire a special outside counsel to conduct an investigation, as was done in the case of former House Speaker James Wright. Wilson Abney, staff director of the ethics panel, wouldn't comment.  = VPE
Indeed it is. Congress has said repeatedly it wants no part of the mess, urging the studios and the networks, which license rights to air shows made by the studios, to work out their own compromise.  = VPE
As the days go by, the South African government will be ever more hard pressed to justify the continued imprisonment of Mr. Mandela as well as the continued banning of the ANC and enforcement of the state of emergency. If it doesn't yield on these matters, and eventually begin talking directly to the ANC, the expectations and promise raised by yesterday's releases will turn to disillusionment and unrest. If it does, the large number of right-wing whites, who oppose any concessions to the black majority, will step up their agitation and threats to take matters into their own hands.  = VPE
South Korea is " important to us now, both economically and in terms of security," says Sen. Richard Lugar ( R., Ind. ), the former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ", many Americans don't think much about Korea. But the miracle of their economic growth and the development of democracy -- imperfect though it is -- are very important to the United States." One major topic during Mr. Roh's visit will be human rights. Due process still is denied in South Korea ; a few months ago, Kim Dae Jung, the major opposition leader, was detained and interrogated for 20 hours by security thugs. Just as Pope John Paul II did in Seoul last week, President Bush and members of Congress ought to tell Mr. Roh in no uncertain terms that this kind of behavior is unacceptable.  = VPE
It's appropriate for U.S. officials to keep hammering for more open trade policies, as U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills did in Seoul last week. But there's also sometimes a tendency in American political circles to pick especially on South Korea, out of frustration over our inability to do much about Japan. That's counterproductive.  = VPE
Still, such a pricing strategy just might appeal to people like Connie Bates, a respondent in the Journal survey. She recently walked out of a furniture store because the salesman offered to cut the price of a sectional couch three times. When a store keeps dropping prices, the Farmington, Mich., resident says, "I get suspicious that they're trying to get the most they can out of you."  = VPE
Recent order rates indicate that the fourth quarter, a time shipments usually pick up, will be weak as well. Merrill Lynch's Mr. Bradford said, "We haven't seen the pickup in flat rolled orders that we should have." Flat rolled steel is the industry's major product.  = VPE
But now, with Bull in firm control, these U.S. operations are key ingredients in Mr. Lorentz's plans to ensure that Bull remains one of the half-dozen or so world-wide, full-range computer companies likely to survive the 1990s. To do so, Bull is planting itself firmly in the U.S., where, says Mr. Lorentz, a lot of the best people and research are. The Zenith buy means Bull will derive 22 % of its revenue from the U.S. -- up from 18 % previously -- and the company spends 30 % of its 3.64 billion-franc research and development budget in the U.S.  = VPE
" " through the Beijing massacre ? This is the buzzword Adi Ignatius chooses to characterize in his review of my book "Tiananmen Diary : Thirteen Days in June " ( Leisire & Arts, Sept. 8 ). I doubt that many readers of this chronicle of the blood and bullets and terror of the Beijing massacre would put it just this way. Nor mistake, as he seems to have done, a raw, rough-cut, unretouched, genuine diary, complete with blips, print lice and all the confusions of real time with high-gloss footnoted academic scholarship. Such works will be forthcoming, but I doubt if they will convey the anguish of what Mr. Ignatius calls my "insta-book."  = VPE
