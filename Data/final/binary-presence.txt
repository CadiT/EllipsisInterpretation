Not only is development of the new company's initial machine tied directly to Mr. Cray, so is its balance sheet. Documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the pending spinoff disclosed that Cray Research Inc. will withdraw the almost $ 100 million in financing it is providing the new firm if Mr. Cray leaves or if the product-design project he heads is scrapped.  :: true
Analysts noted yesterday that Cray Research's decision to link its $ 98.3 million promissory note to Mr. Cray's presence will complicate a valuation of the new company.

But it is Mr. Lane, as movie director, producer and writer, who has been obsessed with refitting Chaplin's Little Tramp in a contemporary way. In 1976, as a film student at the Purchase campus of the State University of New York, Mr. Lane shot "A Place in Time," a 36-minute black-and-white film about a sketch artist, a man of the streets. Now, 13 years later, Mr. Lane has revived his Artist in a full-length movie called "Sidewalk Stories," a poignant piece of work about a modern-day tramp. Of course, if the film contained dialogue, Mr. Lane's Artist would be called a homeless person. So would the Little Tramp, for that matter.  :: true
I say " dialogue " because "Sidewalk Stories " isn't really silent at all. Composer Marc Marder, a college friend of Mr. Lane's who earns his living playing the double bass in classical music ensembles, has prepared an exciting, eclectic score that tells you what the characters are thinking and feeling far more precisely than intertitles, or even words, would.  :: true
The Artist has his routine. He spends his days sketching passers-by, or trying to. At night he returns to the condemned building he calls home. His life, including his skirmishes with a competing sketch artist, seems carefree. He is his own man.  :: true

But maintaining U.S. influence will be difficult in the face of Japanese dominance in the region. Japan not only outstrips the U.S. in investment flows but also outranks it in trade with most Southeast Asian countries ( although the U.S. remains the leading trade partner for all of Asia ). Moreover, the Japanese government, now the world's largest aid donor, is pumping far more assistance into the region than the U.S. is. While U.S. officials voice optimism about Japan's enlarged role in Asia, they also convey an undertone of caution. "There's an understanding on the part of the U.S. that Japan has to expand its functions " in Asia, says J. Michael Farren, undersecretary of commerce for trade. " they approach it with a benevolent, altruistic attitude, there will be a net gain for everyone."  :: true

That explains why the number of these wines is expanding so rapidly. But consumers who buy at this level are also more knowledgeable than they were a few years ago. "They won't buy if the quality is not there," said Cedric Martin of Martin Wine Cellar in New Orleans. " if they feel the wine is overpriced and they can get something equally good for less." Mr. Martin has increased prices on some wines ( like Grgich Hills Chardonnay, now $ 32 ) just to slow down movement, but he is beginning to see some resistance to high-priced red Burgundies and Cabernets and Chardonnays in the $ 30 to $ 40 range.  :: true

Still, some market analysts say the current 3.3 % reading isn't as troublesome as it might have been in years past. "It's not a very meaningful indicator currently because corporations are not behaving in a traditional manner," says James H. Coxon, head of stock investments for Cigna Corp., the Philadelphia-based insurer.  :: true
In particular, Mr. Coxon says, businesses are paying out a smaller percentage of their profits and cash flow in the form of dividends than they have historically. So, while stock prices may look fairly high relative to dividends, they are not excessive relative to the underlying corporate strength.  :: true

He also is a consensus manager, insiders say. The decision to make the bid for Nekoosa, for example, was made only after all six members of Georgia-Pacific's management committee signed onto the deal -- even though Mr. Hahn knew he wanted to go after the company early on, says Mr. Correll. Associates say Mr. Hahn picked up that careful approach to management as president of Virginia Polytechnic Institute. Assuming that post at the age of 35, he managed by consensus, as is the rule in universities, says Warren H. Strother, a university official who is researching a book on Mr. Hahn. But he also showed a willingness to take a strong stand. In 1970, Mr. Hahn called in state police to arrest student protesters who were occupying a university building.  :: true
The framers hardly discussed the appropriations clause at the Constitutional Convention of 1787, according to Madison's notes. To the extent they did, their concern was to ensure fiscal accountability. Moreover, the framers believed that the nation needed a unitary executive with the independence and resources to perform the executive functions that the Confederation Congress had performed poorly under the Articles of Confederation. It would contradict that objective if the appropriations clause ( technically a limitation on legislative power ) could be read as placing the president on Congress's short leash, making the executive consist of the president and every member of Congress.  :: true
President Bush should veto appropriations acts that contain these kinds of unconstitutional conditions on the president's ability to discharge his duties and exercise his prerogatives. If President Bush fails to do so in his first year, he will invite Congress, for the remainder of his presidency, to rewrite Article II of the Constitution to suit its purposes. What becomes custom in the Bush administration will only become more difficult for future presidents, including Democrats, to undo.  :: true
If President Bush loses at the court, it might be disappointing, as Morrison v. Olson was for the Reagan administration. But the presidency would be no worse off than it is now.

Moreover, the electorate would have received a valuable civics lesson in how the separation of powers works in practice.  :: true
As it stands now, Congress presumes after the Reagan administration that the White House will take unconstitutional provisions in appropriations bills lying down.

Department economists don't expect 1989 to be as good a year as 1988 was. Indeed, net cash income is likely to fall this year as farm expenses rise and government payments to farmers decline. At the same time, an increase of land under cultivation after the drought has boosted production of corn, soybeans and other commodities, causing a fall in prices that has been only partly cushioned by heavy grain buying by the Soviets.  :: true
The Herald joins the Baltimore News-American, which folded, and the Boston Herald-American, which was sold, as cornerstones of the old Hearst newspaper empire abandoned by the company in the 1980s. Many felt Hearst kept the paper alive as long as it did, if marginally, because of its place in family history. Its fanciful offices were designed by architect Julia Morgan, who built the Hearst castle at San Simeon. William Randolph Hearst had kept an apartment in the Spanish Renaissance-style building.  :: true

Short of a total ban, some anti-programmers have proposed several middle-ground reforms, which they say would take away certain advantages program traders currently enjoy in the marketplace that other investors don't.  :: true
In point of fact, volatility as measured by the annualized standard deviation of daily stock price movements has frequently been much higher than it is today. Periods before the advent of futures or program trading were often more volatile, usually when fundamental market conditions were undergoing change ( 1973-75, 1937-40, and 1928-33 for example ). It is interesting to see the fundamental stock pickers scream "foul " on program trading when the markets decline, while hailing the great values still abounding as the markets rise. Could rising volatility possibly be related to uncertainty about the economics of stocks, instead of the evil deeds of program-trading goblins ?  :: true
Mr. Egnuss's dislike of program trading is echoed by many small investors interviewed by Wall Street Journal reporters across the country. But like Mr. Egnuss, few expect it to be halted entirely, and a surprising number doubt it should be.  :: true
"I think program trading is basically unfair to the individual investor," says Leo Fields, a Dallas investor. He notes that program traders have a commission cost advantage because of the quantity of their trades, that they have a smaller margin requirement than individual investors do and that they often can figure out earlier where the market is heading.  :: true

Indexing -- Many investors, mainly institutions, follow an investment strategy of buying and holding a mix of stocks to match the performance of a broad stock-market barometer such as the S&P 500.

Many investors wrote asking the SEC to require insiders to report their purchases and sales immediately, not a month later. But Mr. Lane said that while the SEC regulates who files, the law tells them when to do so. Investors who want to change the required timing should write their representatives in Congress, he added. The SEC would likely be amenable to legislation that required insiders to file transactions on a more timely basis, he said.  :: true

No wonder. We were coming down straight into their canal. See, the other rule of thumb about ballooning is that you can't steer. And neither can your pilot. You can go only up or down ( by heating the balloon's air with a propane burner, which does make the top of your head feel hot ) and ride the air currents. Which makes the chase car necessary. Most balloonists seldom go higher than2,000 feet and most average a leisurely 5-10 miles an hour. When the balloon is cruising along at a steady altitude there is little sense of motion. Only when one is ascending -- or in our case descending a tad trop rapidement -- does one feel, well, airborne in a picnic basket.  :: true

I was pleased to note that your Oct. 23 Centennial Journal item recognized the money-fund concept as one of the significant events of the past century. Actually, about two years ago, the Journal listed the creation of the money fund as one of the 10 most significant events in the world of finance in the 20th century. But the Reserve Fund, America's first money fund, was not named, nor were the creators of the money-fund concept, Harry Brown and myself. We innovated telephone redemptions, daily dividends, total elimination of share certificates and the constant $ 1 pershare pricing, all of which were painfully thought out and not the result of some inadvertence on the part of the SEC.  :: true

"You can't say it's a " tsunami " tidal wave ), but we're making some headway," says Fannie Mae's chairman, David O. Maxwell, who visits Tokyo at least once a year to explain and drum up investor interest in mortgage securities. "Interest is a great deal higher than it was a year ago." The steady growth of the mortgage securities market in the U.S. has even triggered talk of building up a similar market here.  :: true
These securities are attractive to Japanese investors for three reasons. First, they are safe. While they aren't backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, as Treasury bonds are, it is widely assumed that the government would support them if necessary. ( U.S. Treasury bonds are still the dollar-denominated investment of choice for long-term Japanese investors ). Second, they are liquid. The secondary market in federally backed mortgage securities now exceeds $ 900 billion, or nearly half of the $ 2.2 trillion in U.S. residential mortgages issued. Third, they offer high yields. At the moment, some offer as much as 1.6 to 1.8 percentage points over Treasury securities of similar maturities.  :: true
In addition, further packaging of mortgage-backed securities, such as Blackstone's fund, have reduced the effects of prepayment risk and automatically reinvest monthly payments so institutions don't have to. Freddie Mac for years has offered a so-called participation certificate that guarantees it won't be prepaid for a set number of years and offers semiannual payments.  :: true
Talks between the two sides could unravel, of course, as they have more than once since Sony announced its plans to hire Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters. But both sides appear to be more willing now to meet each other's terms to resolve the issue.

Mr. Moon planned to convert millions of Americans to his unique brand of Christianity -- in which he plays the role of Old Testament-style temporal, political messiah -- and then to make the U.S. part of a unified international theocracy. His original strategy ( in itself a brilliant innovation for spreading a religion ) was to create new economic enterprises each time he wanted to extend and fund his various religious missions. Tax-exempt airport and street-corner solicitations were intended only to provide start-up funds. More stable industries were to build an economically viable infrastructure for the Moon movement in North America, as they had in Japan and South Korea. Then he would move his movement to Europe.  :: true
An 11-week dispute involving Australia's1,640 domestic pilots has slashed airline earnings and crippled much of the continent's tourist industry. "The only people who are flying are those who have to," said Frank Moore, chairman of the Australian Tourist Industry Association. He added : " is a travel agent going to sell a holiday when he can not guarantee a return flight ?

Finally, I think it important to point out the extraordinarily high visibility of non-violent civil disobedience in these days of intensive media coverage. Give television a chance to cover live any breaking of the law, and no second invitation will be required. This brings into question the motives of those who lead civil disobedience demonstrations. Do they want the spotlight for themselves or for their cause ? Here is a good rule of thumb : If the movement produced the leader, the chance that he is sincere is much greater than if the leader produced the movement. In either case, ask yourself whether you have become better informed on the issues under protest by watching the act of civil disobedience. If you have not, it is probable that a thorough airing of the dispute by calm and rational debate would have been the better course.  :: true
J. Nicholas Hahn, Cotton Inc.'s president and chief executive, was an outspoken critic of WPP Group's acquisition of Ogilvy Group earlier this year. During the takeover, Mr. Hahn said he would put his account up for review if WPP's bid were successful, but he didn't.  :: true

We hear that HUD Secretary Jack Kemp is toying with going along with some of the Cranston-Mitchell proposals. That sounds like a formula for ensuring that he gets dragged into the next HUD tar pit. A group of 27 Senators has written Mr. Kemp urging him to reject Cranston-Mitchell and focus on programs that empower the poor rather than create vast new government obligations. But even if he agrees, Mr. Kemp doesn't write the nation's housing law -- Congress does. And the majority of Members cynically view the current discrediting of HUD as mainly a chance to shove through their own slate of projects.  :: true
"Most people -- whether in Toledo, Tucson or Topeka -- haven't got a clue who we are," says Guy L. Smith, Philip Morris's vice president of corporate affairs.

Mr. Smith says the Bill of Rights commercial, which trumpets the themes of liberty and freedom of expression, isn't designed to have any special appeal for smokers. Although Philip Morris typically tries to defend the rights of smokers with free-choice arguments, "this has nothing to do with cigarettes, nor will it ever," the spokesman says.  :: true
That nets out to about $ 17 a share for the company on a private market basis. But Santa Fe, currently trading at 18 7\, isn't likely to realize private market values by selling assets, because the tax against it would be onerous.

By concentrating all their resources on the pay raise, Wright and Tower, the networks actually overlooked some major stories that showed the flaws and shortcomings of the institution.... An imaginative producer could easily have created a fast-moving and interesting piece about how Congress really works -- and why voters in, say, West Virginia got a federally funded university project and building while voters in Arkansas did not. But nobody did such a piece, reflecting a contemporary axiom : the more a scandal has to do with a congressman's duties as a congressman, the less likely it is to catch the fancy of a network.  :: true
What Ms. Pfeiffer had going for her besides determination -- Ms. Stevens recalled that the actress was up one night until 3 a.m. practicing "My Funny Valentine " -- was an airy alto, a nice breathy quality and intelligence. " we first started working it was a matter of finding a language we both understood," Ms. Stevens said. "I couldn't talk with her as I would with someone who had a lot of vocal training."  :: true
So what Ms. Stevens talked about was the importance of saying the words at the front of the mouth with the lips and the teeth. She urged Ms. Pfeiffer to get the feeling of a smile in her throat and to put a smile on her face to give the pitch and the sound a lift. She kept harping on the importance of overdoing the consonants and percussive endings like "T " and "K." She talked about using language as a tool, about flirting with the lyrics. And please, Michelle, when you sing the line in "Makin' Whoopee," about another sunny, funny honeymoon, don't say "funn-ih," the way Dylan would. Say "funn-eeee." Put the clean vowel ending on it. And Michelle, must you continue to smoke two packs of cigarettes a day ?  :: true
All 50 states require that small children be strapped into safety seats in cars. On planes, FAA rules dictate that children two years old and over have their own tickets and be strapped into regular seats, just as adults are. Babies under two may sit on laps and fly for free.

First, addressing the Oct. 13 market break, this was certainly more of a technical gyration and a local jungle exercise, than an investor reaction to the day's political events in Washington. Look not to the managers of taxable investment funds as the source of selling late that afternoon, but rather to several of the usual suspects ( " " banks and institutions ) geared up with imperfect trading programs that accelerate market deterioration, once begun. The catalyst for this decline was, indeed, the breakdown of the United Airlines transaction and its resultant pre-margin call liquidation of various holdings by arbitragers and other traders. I can assure Mr. Wanniski that the market is not as politically motivated as he is.  :: true
Some analysts have said Courtaulds' moves could boost the company's value by 5 % to 10 %, because the two entities separately will carry a higher price earnings multiple than they did combined. In addition, Courtaulds said the moves are logical because they will allow both the chemicals and textile businesses to focus more closely on core activities.  :: true
But raising stock-index futures margins could make the stock market even more volatile, futures traders contend. Higher margins would price many professional speculators -- whose trades help futures markets function smoothly -- out of business. If these speculators can't afford to trade as actively as before, stock-index futures prices, and therefore stock prices, may have to fall further than they might otherwise to attract buyers.  :: true
Warner and Mr. Azoff declined comment, as did MCA, where Mr. Azoff had also been discussing such a venture. But record industry executives familiar with the talks said Mr. Azoff and Warner came to an agreement yesterday to form a 50-50 joint-venture company funded by Warner and run by Mr. Azoff. Among other things, they said, Mr. Azoff would develop musical acts for a new record label.  :: true
The agreement is said to be similar to Warner's 50-50 partnership with record and movie producer David Geffen, whose films and records are distributed by the Warner Bros. studio and the Warner records unit.

The closeness of Soviet perestroika to the fascist social blueprint of Mussolini was evident when Mr. Gorbachev presented his economic vision to the Soviet Congress. In doing so, he neither rejected a socialist planned economy nor embraced the free market. Instead, he proposed a "law-governed economy," in which there would be a "clear-cut division between state direction of the economy and economic management."

Mr. Gorbachev is in a much stronger position to pursue the corporatist ideal than was Mussolini, who was never able to influence business giants such as Pirelli and Fiat. The Soviet Communist Party has the power to shape corporate development and mold it into a body dependent upon it.  :: true
The U.S. market, too, is dominated by a giant, International Business Machines Corp. But early on, IBM offered its basic design to anybody wanting to copy it. Dozens of small companies did, swiftly establishing a standard operating system. That spurs competition and growth, allows users to change and mix brands easily, and increases software firms' incentive to write packages because they can be sold to users of virtually any computer.  :: true
In Japan, "software is four to five years behind the U.S. because hardware is four to five years behind, because NEC is enjoying a monopoly," complains Kazuhiko Nishi, the president of Ascii Corp., one of Japan's leading PC-magazine publishing and software companies. "There are no price wars, no competition." An NEC spokeswoman responds that prices are higher in Japan because customers put a greater emphasis on quality and service than they do in the U.S. She adds that some technological advances trail those in the U.S. because the Japanese still import basic operating systems from American companies.  :: true
But the Americans are also to blame. They long made little effort here. IBM, though long a leader in the Japanese mainframe business, didn't introduce its first PC in Japan until five years after NEC did, and that wasn't compatible even with the U.S. IBM standard. Apple didn't introduce a kanji machine -- one that handles the Chinese characters of written Japanese -- until three years after entering the market. Critics also say American companies charge too much. Japan's FTC says it is investigating Apple for allegedly discouraging retailers from discounting.  :: true
Supporters of index arbitrage haven't been publicly sticking up for the trading strategy, as some did during the post-crash outcry of 1987. But Merrill Lynch, in its statement about pulling out of index arbitrage, suggested that the current debate has missed the mark.  :: true
"Due to the earthquake in San Francisco, Nissan is donating its commercial air time to broadcast American Red Cross Emergency Relief messages. Please contribute what you can," the ad said. The Nissan logo flashed on the screen for a moment, and then came a taped plea for donations from former President Reagan -- followed by the silent print telling viewers where to call. Within two hours, viewers pledged over $400,000, according to a Red Cross executive.  :: true
Toyota's upscale Lexus division, a sponsor of the World Series, also put in a plug for Red Cross donations in a World Series game it sponsored. "The World Series is brought to you by Lexus, who urges you to help relieve the suffering caused by the recent earthquake...," the game announcer said. And New York Life made a plea for Red Cross donations in newspaper ads in the San Francisco area, latching onto the coattails of the Red Cross's impeccable reputation : "The Red Cross has been helping people for 125 years. New York Life has been doing the same for over 140 years."  :: true
Yesterday, Joel Zweibel, an attorney for Eastern's creditors committee, declined to comment on whether the experts had ever been instructed to look at other choices and whether they now were asked not to. He said only that the committee has not yet taken any position on Eastern's reorganization plan and that the two sides were still negotiating. " every case, people would like to see a consentual plan," he said.  :: true
"One thing that is a little unnerving is that you had three old men on the court of appeals in California coming up with a statement that Nancy Sinatra is not distinctive but that Bette Midler is. I am not sure that judges, many of whom I like very much, are proper repositories for making distinctions about pop singers," said Richard Kurnit, a New York advertising lawyer.  :: true
But even that group knows some people don't use their machines as much as they should. "The first excuse is they don't have enough time," says research director Thomas Doyle. "The second is they don't have enough discipline." With more than 15 million exercise bikes sold in the past five years, he adds, "a lot of garages, basements and attics must be populated with them."  :: true
Moreover, Japanese offices tend to use computers less efficiently than American offices do. In the U.S., PCs commonly perform many tasks and plug into a broad network. In Japan, many desktop terminals are limited to one function and can't communicate with other machines.  :: true
Last Thursday, PaineWebber Group Inc. also said it would cease index arbitrage altogether, but the firm wasn't as big an index arbitrager as Merrill is. Other large firms, including Bear, Stearns & Co. and Morgan Stanley & Co., last week announced a pullback from index arbitrage, but only for the firms' own accounts.  :: true

One could imagine such a lull in the lives of the Arabs before the quadrupling of oil prices. For just as the Arabs were in the 1960s, the farmers of Sidhpur are on the brink of global power and fame. The Arabs had merely oil. These farmers may have a grip on the world's very heart. Or, at least, its heart disease.  :: true
Some business analysts blame the problem on tough competition in the insurance market. They say insurance companies use policies aimed at excluding bad risks because their competitors do. But the general practice makes it more difficult to combine small groups of people into larger groups, thus spreading the risk over a larger base of premiums.  :: true
Industry executives and analysts are divided on whether Mr. Phillips is up to the task. He isn't as well-known to clients as is Mr. Roman. Under his watch, office politicking was often rampant in the agency's New York operation and the office there has had a dismal new-business record for more than a year. And while last week the agency hired a top Chiat\ executive, Bill Hamilton, to try to bolster its work, "Graham has to get the revenue of that New York office moving," says James Dougherty, an analyst with County NatWest Securities.  :: true
At Wells Rich, Ms. Heller will concentrate on accounts that include Philip Morris's Benson & Hedges cigarette brand, which relies on print ads, Ms. Heller's specialty.

And to protect their reduced capital investment from eroding further, market makers became quicker to lower price quotes when sell programs are in progress. On days when prices are tumbling, they must be willing to buy shares from sellers when no one else will. In such an environment, market makers can suffer huge losses both on trades made that day at steadily dropping prices and in the value of their inventories of shares.  :: true
Mr. Bush has pledged as well to respect the 14-year-old executive order barring U.S. agents from assassinating foreign leaders or helping others to do so. Congress never fully trusted former CIA chief William Casey and National Security Adviser John Poindexter to honor the ban.  :: true
The Brookings and Urban Institute authors caution, however, that most nursing home stays are of comparatively short duration, and reaching the Medicaid level is more likely with an unusually long stay or repeated stays. Moreover, they note, those who manage to pay their own way often do so only by selling their homes, using up life savings or drawing heavily on children and other relatives.  :: true
But as astounding as the changes that have already occurred are, there is a fragility to glasnost. Censorship isn't a Marxist invention. The czars were no civil libertarians. As late as the 1890s, the Russian government prevented any coverage of famines. It even directed newspapers not to publish anything that might stain the honor of the Turkish sultan's wives. So glasnost is not a value woven with steel threads into the fabric of Russian society. It is an admirable public relations program initiated by a single political leader during a four-year blink of history. It is public relations of the highest sophistication, that recognizes that credibility is enhanced by honesty -- up to a point.  :: true
Judge Albert Green, in Cook County Circuit Court in Chicago, also recognized the suit, filed last May by Robert and Cynthia Langendorf, as a class action covering thousands of Irving customers.

To reduce the danger of such pricing cycles, Akzo has invested heavily in specialty chemicals, which have highly specific industrial uses and tend to produce much higher profit margins than do bulk chemicals.

The marriage of news and theater, if not exactly inevitable, has been consummated nonetheless. News programs, particularly if they score well in the ratings, appeal to the networks' cost-conscious corporate parents because they are so much less expensive to produce than an entertainment show is -- somewhere between $400,000 and $500,000 for a one-hour program. Entertainment shows tend to cost twice that. Re-enactments have been used successfully for several seasons on such syndicated "tabloid TV " shows as "A Current Affair," which is produced by the Fox Broadcasting Co. unit of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. That show, whose host is Ms. Chung's husband, Maury Povich, has a particular penchant for grisly murders and stories having to do with sex -- the Robert Chambers murder case, the Rob Lowe tapes, what have you.  :: true
Although acquiring a foreign company would expand Japanese advertising agencies' business to foreign clients, many clients would also be Japanese companies expanding overseas, says the Dentsu spokesman.

Data Resources' Mr. Wyss added that he will be keeping a closer eye than ususal on October chain-store sales. Usually, October "n't a very interesting month { for retail figures } because school clothes have been bought and people are waiting for December to buy Christmas presents," he said.

Accepted theories of asset pricing offer a perfectly legitimate explanation. Accepted theories state that investors require higher returns on riskier investments. Thus, rather than seeing the excess returns to the pro-selected portfolio as being abnormal, I see those returns as simply compensations for taking on added risk. I believe the risk for each individual stock selected by your pros is very large. If you asked me to select a stock with the highest expected return, I would select a stock with the greatest amount of undiversifiable risk, as I am sure your pros do. Your hypothetical investor is simply being compensated for taking on this added risk.  :: true

We read with interest Robert Tomsho's Sept. 28 page-one article on Robert Redford ( " Sundance Kid Gets Little Respect Around Sundance " ). Misunderstanding conversations with us, Mr. Tomsho argued that Mr. Redford's environmental views are at odds with Utah residents. This may have been true 10 years ago, but times have changed, even in Utah. Mr. Redford no longer stands out as an extremist. He has not changed, but those around him have. Many of his views on the protection of wilderness areas, rivers and canyons are now embraced by mainstream, conservative Utahans.  :: true
The football and basketball players spent more time on their sports in season than they did on class attendance and homework combined ( 30 hours a week versus 25.3 ).

But even those numbers don't describe the situation as well as the athletes do in their own words. The composite portrait that emerges isn't of a pampered jock marking time until he can land a seven-figure pro contract -- he's part of a tiny minority.

In an interview with reporters and editors of The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Dinkins appears quite confident of victory and of his ability to handle the mayoralty. "A lot of people think I will give away the store, but I can assure you I will not," he says. "I am aware we have real budgetary problems."  :: true
No doubt, Mr. Dinkins has been a calming influence. He is an avuncular figure who remembers the birthdays of colleagues' children, opens doors for women, and almost never has a bad word to say about anybody. More important, he emerged as a peacemaker last summer after the Central Park rape of a white jogger -- in which a group of Harlem teens was charged -- and the racial murder of a black teen-ager in the white Brooklyn neighborhood of Bensonhurst. Rather than scaring off white voters, as many predicted he would, Mr. Dinkins attracted many whites precisely because of his reputation for having a cool head. ( Keeping cool is a Dinkins priority : On humid days this summer, he was known to change his double-breasted suits as many as four times a day. )  :: true
Mr. Dinkins also has failed to allay Jewish voters' fears about his association with the Rev. Jesse Jackson, despite the fact that few local non-Jewish politicians have been as vocal for Jewish causes in the past 20 years as Mr. Dinkins has.  :: true
Another close ally is Ruth Messinger, a Manhattan city councilwoman, some of whose programs, such as commercial rent control, have made their way into Mr. Dinkins's position papers. If she remains influential with Mr. Dinkins, as some suggest she will, his mayoralty may take on a more anti-development flavor.  :: true
But Lincoln Center President Nathan Leventhal, who would head a Dinkins transition team, is more mainstream, as is real-estate executive Anthony Gliedman, another insider.

"Legislation tends to be compromised. I believe we have to take a shot at getting as much done as we can through the court, through Justice and through state and federal regulatory agencies.

The reality of life in modern America is that if you want to wreck something that works, let it fall into the hands of Congress.  :: true
The bill also would give the SEC the power to close the markets, a discretion that former SEC Chairman David Ruder wanted but Mr. Breeden doesn't.  :: true
The markets are complex, as is the environment in which they function. When problems surface, the temptation becomes strong to summarily overhaul a market system that has served for more than 100 years. That temptation must be put aside to permit careful consideration of all the implications, positive and negative, of the proposed resolutions to those problems, and to avoid creating a marketplace where no one trades.  :: true
As a critique of middle-class mores, the story is heavy-handed. But its unsentimental sketches of Cairo life are vintage Mahfouz. We see, smell and hear slums filled with "the echoes of hawkers advertising their wares interspersed with abusive language, rattling coughs and the sound of people gathering spittle in their throats and spewing into the street." And we meet engaging crooks, such as Hassan "the Head," famed for his head-butting fights, his whoring and his hashish. "God has not yet ordained that I should have earnings,' he tells his worried mother." Hassan comes to a bad end, but so does almost everyone else in the book.  :: true
Said's story reflects the souring of socialism under Nasser, whose dictatorial rule replaced the monarchy overthrown in 1952. By 1961, Mr. Mahfouz's idealism had vanished or become twisted, as it has in Said. His giddy dream of redeeming a life of " aimed bullets " by punishing the "real robbers " -- the rich "dogs " who prey on the poor -- leads only to the death of innocents, and eventually to his own.  :: true
Cairo's spirited squalor also has gone gray. Here, the city is dark and laden with symbolism : Said has left his jail cell only to enter the larger prison of Cairo society. While the theme is compelling, the plot and characters are not. We never care about Said or the "hypocrites " he hunts. "The Thief and the Dogs " is a pioneering work, the first stream-of-consciousness novel in Arabic, but it is likely to disappoint Western readers.  :: true

What tongue to speak is an emotional mine field in the Philippines. It is entrenched in the country's colonial bonds to the U.S., in Philippine class structure, in the regional loyalties of its people and in its island geography. As they did when the Philippines was a colony of the U.S., teachers for the most part teach in English, even though it is a foreign language for most Philippine children. As a result, they often speak one language at home, another at school. Mrs. Brown calls the modern-day cultural ambivalence to Filipino a "language schizophrenia."  :: true
Admittedly last season's runaway hit, "Steel Magnolias," helped a lot, but so did cost cutting and other measures insisted on by the board.

Among the arguments Sony makes is that Warner should let the producers go to Columbia because it already allowed the producers to become co-chairmen of publicly held Barris Industries Inc., which earlier this year changed its name to Guber Peters Entertainment.

In 1984, Howard Conant, a director of Valspar Corp., donated to Goodwill Industries Inc. of Chicago an eight-acre site on the city's west side, where Valspar had operated a paint factory. Goodwill planned to sell the property and pocket the proceeds, as it had in many similar cases.  :: true
Mr. Jeancourt-Galignani refused to say whether Indosuez will bid for all of Morgan Grenfell when its year is up. If it does, the operation would be one of the largest foreign purchases of a U.K merchant bank. It would catapult Indosuez from the position of a marginal London player, with strong Asian and Middle Eastern activities, to the upper levels of the U.K. merchant banking scene. It is part of Indosuez's overall plan of building its business across Europe, as the 1992 reduction of European Community market barriers looms.  :: true

Though jolted by the surrounding confusion, Mrs. Thatcher emerged in undisputed command of her government's economic program. Neil Kinnock, Labor Party leader, dubbed the 46-year-old Mr. Major a "lap dog " unlikely to veer from his boss's strongly held views, as Mr. Lawson sometimes did.  :: true
Worn down by the feud, he then made it clear to Mrs. Thatcher that he expected the controversial adviser to be ousted. In remarks in Commons yesterday afternoon, the prime minister disappointed him.

The shortcomings of delaying the reward, as Sen. Roth and Sen. Robert Packwood ( R., Ore. ) propose, is that it may not boost savings much and, if it does, it may widen deficits in the future.

Republican senators, unwilling to concede the popular IRA issue to Democrats, suddenly embraced a scheme Sen. Roth had been pressing with little success.

The designation at July's economic summit of major industrialized nations of the EC Commission as coordinator of Western aid to Poland and Hungary was a first step. In part, this division is dictated by economics : West Germany is a net exporter of capital while the U.S. isn't.

"I transmitted my conversations to the White House," Prof. Lee says. But, he adds, "I was not acting as a messenger." He says that the Chinese never asked him to convey their statements to President Bush, but that the White House spontaneously invited him to do so.

In recent weeks, moreover, Mr. Brady has joined other administration officials in trying to urge the Fed toward lower interest rates. The urging admittedly has been gentle.

All of which has enabled those of us in Washington who enjoy wallowing in such things to go into high public dudgeon, as Mr. Apple and I did the other night on ABC's " Nightline. " away, we raised what I still think were all the right issues and landed more than one hard blow, but at the end of the affair, there was just the tiniest nagging worry that we had been aiming at the wrong target. As one of his defenders so aptly put it, President Reagan was simply doing what he had always done before his election ( and some would say thereafter as well ). He was performing for pay, and why should anyone expect anything more ?  :: true
To the rest of us, the case is a puzzle. It is what lawyers call "fact intensive." It presents no great issue of legal principle, no overriding question of family law or the law of contempt. Instead, it turns on the disputed and elusive facts of "who did what to whom." It is difficult, if not impossible, for anyone who has not pored over the thousands of pages of court pleadings and transcripts to have a worthwhile opinion on the underlying merits of the controversy. Certainly I do not.  :: true
The first is that it represents an intense battle in what James Thurber used to caricature as "the war between the sexes." But although Thurber did so gently and lightheartedly, many of Dr. Morgan's supporters have taken Thurber's memorable title "The Male Animal " quite literally. The vehemence of the emotions aroused by the case testifies to its symbolic importance in the war that Thurber accepted as an eternal part of the human condition.  :: true
Finally, the case of Dr. Morgan gave Congress an opportunity to act with unaccustomed decisiveness and to engage in one of its favorite pastimes -- bashing the District of Columbia government. The local government is discredited in the eyes of many residents for a variety of reasons, and congressmen read the same newspapers and watch the same TV newscasts as other people in the area do. Bashing the D.C. government is risk-free for members of Congress, who do not have to answer to their own constituents for it.  :: true
 some at the SEC, an agency that covets its independence, Mr. Breeden may be too much of a Washington insider. They note that he has adorned his office with five photos of George Bush, one of them featuring the First Dog, Millie. They worry that Mr. Breeden also will roll over when told to do so by the White House. But Mr. Breeden already has shown an eagerness to run the SEC his way. During the Monday market rebound, a New York exchange spokesman told Cable News Network viewers that the industrial average had turned down 70 points. Stunned, Mr. Breeden turned to his market-monitoring computer, which by then was next to his desk. It showed the DJIA up 30 points.  :: true

Probably, it didn't.  :: true
National Convenience said it has tested its new merchandise mix in 100 stores, with favorable results. Analysts said the company's effort will be helped by its decision last year to put point-of-sale scanners in 200 stores, allowing National Convenience to quickly track items that are selling and those that aren't.  :: true
Linda and Michael ( Ms. Close and Mr. Woods ), who seem to be pushing 40, live in a large and tastefully decorated home in suburban Seattle. All of their friends have children and they can't, so now they want a child more than anything -- perhaps even more than Michael wanted his fancy convertible or his deluxe stereo equipment. The idea of a child-as-required-yuppie-possession must be motivating them, since the wealthy offspring of their friends are shown to be rude brats, in therapy by age five.  :: true

The Soviet Union should keep these lessons in mind as it seeks to establish the ruble as an international currency. One way to make the ruble into a major international currency would be to leave reserves of gold and earning assets in a Swiss bank with distributions based on Swiss laws. Unless the laws determining the noteholder's rights to payment are independent of the issuer of those notes, however, a gold-based ruble would be as unsuccessful for the Soviets as it was for the czars.

The junk-mail titans, ever optimistic, are looking for ways around the problem. So far, they say, it hasn't had any noticeable effect on response rates. And before it does, they're trying to cut back on the clutter that created the situation in the first place. Among other things, the industry is trying to come up with standardized business lists that cut down on duplications. "We're going to have to mail a lot less and a lot smarter," says Jack Miller, president of Quill Corp., a Lincolnshire, Ill., business-to-business mail-order company. But then again, mailing less and smarter won't be much help if the mail ends up in the garbage anyway.  :: true
In 1986, some institute patients were reporting breakthrough seizures when they were switched from a specific brand-name medication to a generic one or from one generic manufacturer of a specific product to another. In addition, neurologists were beginning to report these observations as well. Call it anecdotal if you will. But no ethical physician would switch patients who were doing well on a specific medication from a specific manufacturer to prove a point.  :: true
"Traffic is certainly a concern, as is pollution, water and an adequate labor market," says Frank Sain, executive director of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Bureau. City fathers have managed to push through projects that are crucial for tourist growth, such as the expansion of McCarran International Airport to accommodate the 44 % of Las Vegas tourists who fly here. This year, by one means of transport or another, more than 18 million people will visit the city.  :: true
Will the investments pay off ? The growth of Las Vegas tourism in recent years persuades lenders that they will. Casino revenues and hotel occupancy rates are high. Last year, the tourists left $ 3 billion with the area's casinos, nearly 10 % more than in 1987. The people with a stake in Nevada's gambling industry believe that they have barely tapped the potentially huge family trade.  :: true

The Morgan case thus tells us much more about the current state of sex, class, race and politics in our society than it does about the facts of Dr. Morgan's particular situation. It may stand as a metaphor for how wide and deep the divisions in that society continue to be however we try to deny their existence.  :: true
The Bank of England, on the other hand, had gold reserves that averaged about 30 % of its outstanding currency, and Bank of England notes were accepted throughout the world. The most likely reason for this disparity is that the Bank of England was a private bank with substantial earning assets, and the common-law rights of creditors to collect claims against the bank were well established in Britain. By contrast, in 19th-century Russia an authoritarian government owned the bank and had the power to revoke payment whenever it chose, much as it would in today's Soviet Union.  :: true
Morgan Stanley and Kidder Peabody, the two biggest program trading firms, staunchly defend their strategies.

The burning question is whether the new chief can parry Mr. Icahn without being pushed into unwelcome moves. Mr. Corry might have to dismember the company more than he wants to. Or he might have to incur a huge expense of either buying Mr. Icahn's stock, possibly at a premium, or paying stockholders a special dividend partly because of Mr. Icahn's pressure.  :: true
With his recent purchases of USX common stock, Mr. Icahn shattered a three-year-old, unwritten standstill agreement with Mr. Roderick. In 1986, Mr. Roderick adroitly dodged Mr. Icahn's first bullet after the takeover specialist had built up an 11.4 % stake. Mr. Roderick did so by having USX redeem a series of guaranteed notes, a move that, in effect, raised the cost of a $ 7.19 billion Icahn bid by about $ 3 billion. And he managed to fend off further advances and even strike up an unlikely friendship with the interloper. Over dinners at New York's Sky Club and Links Club restaurants, the steel executive and the big investor talked steel, international trade and thoroughbred horses.  :: true
The 57-year-old tax attorney never even aspired to the job of chief executive. An undistinguished college student who dabbled in zoology until he concluded that he couldn't stand cutting up frogs, Mr. Corry wanted to work for a big company "that could do big things." But after joining the tax department of a USX subsidiary 30 years ago, he set the modest goal of becoming tax manager by the age of 46. For years, he quietly stuck to the back accounting rooms, wearing a hat to work because everyone else did. "I was never a rebel," he said in an earlier interview. "I don't think most of the people that have been around me would ever say they've seen me pound the table or get angry."  :: true

A Japanese apple called the Fuji is cropping up in orchards the way Hondas did on U.S. roads. By 1995 it will be planted more often than any other apple tree, according to a recent survey of six apple-industry sages by Washington State University horticulturist Robert Norton. Some fruit visionaries say the Fuji could someday tumble the Red Delicious from the top of America's apple heap.  :: true
Mr. Auvil, razor sharp at 83, has picked and packed a zillion pecks of apples over the past 65 years. He is known as the father of the U.S.-grown Granny Smith, a radically different apple that the conventional wisdom once said would never catch on. It did, shaking the apple establishment to its roots. Now, even more radical changes seem afoot as the grand old maverick of American apples plays the role of Hiroshi Appleseed. "The Fuji is going to be No. 1 to replace the Red Delicious," he says.  :: true
Supermarkets are getting into the variety act, too. They still buy apples mainly for big, red good looks -- that's why so many taste like woodchucks' punching bags. But freshness counts more than it once did, and stores are expanding shelf space for unconventional, but tastier, and often pricier, apples. " than sell 39-cents-a-pound Delicious, maybe we can sell 79-cents-a-pound Fujis," says Chuck Tryon, perishables director for Super Valu Inc., a Minneapolis supermarket chain and food distributor.  :: true
Instead of proposing a complete elimination of farm subsidies, as the earlier U.S. proposal did, the new package calls for the elimination of only the most tradedistorting ones.

The new goal of the Voting Rights Act -- more minorities in political office -- is laudable. For the political process to work, all citizens, regardless of race, must feel represented. One essential indicator that they are is that members of minority groups get elected to public office with reasonable frequency. As is, blacks constitute 12 % of the population, but fewer than 2 % of elected leaders. But racial gerrymandering is not the best way to accomplish that essential goal. It is a quick fix for a complex problem.  :: true
By not choosing one of these options, Israelis will condemn themselves, as the Maronites did, to perpetual war with the Muslims in their midst, and so to the internal erosion of their state. Unlike the Maronites, Israel's Jews will not let themselves become the weakest force in a system of private armies ; Jerusalem will become Belfast before it becomes Beirut. But that is not much of a consolation to draw from the failure of General Aoun.  :: true
The volatility inherent in program trading troubled other traders, too. They don't like the risks they are forced to assume when prices swing so drastically. Market makers are supposed to keep supplies of stocks on hand to maintain orderly trading when imbalances occur. That means that on days when prices are tumbling and sellers abound they must be willing to buy shares from sellers when no one else will. In such an environment, a market maker can absorb huge losses.  :: true
But by the time Solidarity took office in September, the damage was done. "Shortageflation," as economists have come to call it, had gone hyper. The cost of raising a pig kept bounding ahead of the return for selling one. The farmers stayed angry. They still are.  :: true
Edward Chojnowski does. His truck is parked across the field, in a row of grain sellers. Like the others, it is loaded with rye, wheat and oats in sacks labeled "Asbestos. Made in U.S.S.R."

Poland's 2.7 million small private farms cover 76 % of its arable land. On it, a quarter of the country's 39 million people produce three-quarters of its grain, beef, eggs and milk, and nine-tenths of its fruit, vegetables and potatoes. Like the Roman Catholic Church, the Polish peasant is a pillar of the nation. Try as they might, the Communists could neither replace nor break him. And they did try.  :: true
The state quit shoving peasants onto its subsidized farms over 30 years ago. But it never did let up on the pressure. Until recently, a farmer with no heir had to will the state his land to collect his pension. The pension's size still depends on how much produce he sells the state. His allotment of materials also did, until the state couldn't hold up its end of that bargain. Yet the state alone sells seeds and machines. When supplies are short, it often hands them over only in exchange for milk or grain.  :: true
The stock market's precipitous drop frightened foreign investors, who quickly bid the dollar lower. But as stock prices recovered some of the early losses, so did the U.S. currency. Although dealers said investors are becoming more bearish toward the dollar in the wake of the stock market's recent troubles and as the U.S. economy weakens, the dollar ended down only modestly.  :: true
Given the prelude's thematic connections with the music preceding the last act, the idea is more worn than bad, though as luck would have it, for a change there actually was a conductor in the pit whom we wanted to hear, Carlos Kleiber, trying to make memorable music while we all waited for the bed lump to stir into song. Once she did so, the big-souled German maestro with the shaky nerves who so often cancels offered a limpid, flowing performance that in its unswagged and unswaggering approach was totally at odds with the staging.  :: true
Speaking of dark nights, the Met's next-door neighbor, the New York City Opera, has canceled its season after failing to reach a settlement with its musicians, who wanted pay parity with the the Chicago Lyric and San Francisco Opera orchestras.

Common sense suggests that people who play for a company that charges about half what those houses do for a ticket are not in the same market.  :: true

Despite their ubiquity, the consultants aren't entirely welcome. Some lawyers and scholars see the social scientists' vision of the American jury system as a far cry from the ideal presented in civics texts and memorialized on the movie screen. In the film classic "Twelve Angry Men," the crucible of deliberations unmasks each juror's bias and purges it from playing a role in the verdict. After hours of conflict and debate, that jury focuses on the facts with near-perfect objectivity. In real life, jurors may not always work that way, but some court observers question why they shouldn't be encouraged to do so rather than be programmed not to.  :: true

Litigation Sciences doesn't make moral distinctions. If a client needs prejudiced jurors, the firm will help find them. As Mr. Vinson explains it, "We don't control the facts. They are what they are. But any lawyer will select the facts and the strategy to employ. In our system of advocacy, the trial lawyer is duty bound to present the best case he possibly can."  :: true
Some litigators scoff at the notion that a sociologist knows more than they do about what makes a jury tick. "The essence of being a trial lawyer is understanding how people of diverse backgrounds react to you and your presentation," says Barry Ostrager of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, who recently won a huge case on behalf of insurers against Shell Oil Co.

That's a lot of banishment, as it turns out. CFCs are the primary ingredient in a gas, often referred to by the Du Pont trade name Freon, which is compressed to liquid form to serve as the cooling agent in refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment. Gases containing CFCs are pumped into polyurethane to make the foam used in pillows, upholstery and insulation. Polyurethane foam is a highly efficient insulator, which accounts for why the walls of refrigerators and freezers can be thinner now than they were back in the days when they were insulated with glass fiber.  :: true

But it is unfair to dump on teachers, as distinct from the educational establishment. I know many schoolteachers and, on the whole, they are seriously committed to conscientious teaching. They may not be among the "best and brightest " of their generation -- there are very few such people, by definition. But they need not be to do their jobs well. Yes, we all can remember one or two truly inspiring teachers from our school days. But our education proceeded at the hands of those others, who were merely competent and conscientious. In this sense, a teacher can be compared to one's family doctor. If he were brilliant, he probably would not be a family doctor in the first place. If he is competent and conscientious, he serves us well.  :: true
Drexel says it doesn't expect any of its state brokerage licenses will be revoked, and even if some are, its securities business wouldn't be directly hurt.

Scowcroft knows as well as anyone that one of the biggest dangers he faces is that NSC staffers working in relative anonymity will take over policy-making and operational tasks that are best left to bigger and more experienced State Department and Pentagon bureaus. But just as every previous NSC adviser has, Gen. Scowcroft now will have to mull at what point the NSC staff becomes too lean and too restrained.  :: true
Mr. Jones has also beefed up his marketing staff to sell the 118 luxury suites topping Texas Stadium ( his deal with Bum Bright included operating rights for the stadium ). The suites are air-conditioned, have wet bars and plush seating, and offer a clear view of the field -- all for a sale price of $475,000 to $ 1 million, depending on their size and location. Mr. Jones has been taking prospective suite owners onto the field during practice to let them rub elbows with players, and promises those who actually buy one of the rooms an insider's look at the team's strategy before game time. The sales job seems to be paying off : When he bought the team, only six of the suites had been sold. Today, 30 have.  :: true

That would give the Pentagon flexibility that no other federal agency has. "It's simply a way of making the cuts less onerous for defense than they are for domestic programs," said Chairman James Sasser ( D., Tenn. ) of the Senate Budget Committee, who said he would oppose the request. "That isn't consistent with the kind of discipline that Gramm-Rudman is supposed to impose," he said.  :: true

-- Saturday morning, a resident was given 15 minutes to scurry into a sagging building and reclaim what she could of her life's possessions. Saturday night she dined in an emergency shelter on salmon steaks prepared by chefs from one of the city's four-star restaurants.  :: true
Out on the streets, some residents of badly damaged buildings were allowed a 15-minute scavenger hunt through their possessions. "It's so weird to have to decide what's really important to you," said Barbara May. She went first for personal mementos. In post-earthquake parlance, her building is a "red." After being inspected, buildings with substantial damage were color-coded. Green allowed residents to re-enter ; yellow allowed limited access ; red allowed residents one last entry to gather everything they could within 15 minutes.  :: true
Three International Cash Portfolios funds, which invest almost exclusively in bonds and money-market instruments overseas, were among the four top-performing funds in the latest week. Because the funds' investments are denominated in foreign currencies, their value expressed in dollars goes up when those currencies rise against the dollar. But when the dollar rises against major foreign currencies, as it did for much of this year, the dollar value of these funds declines. All three funds posted negative returns for the year to date.  :: true
Comsat Video is headed by Robert Wussler, who resigned his No. 2 executive post with Turner Broadcasting System Inc. just two weeks ago to take the Comsat position.

Messrs. Lee and Bynoe will manage the Nuggets' day-today affairs.  :: true
The new technologies are intended to retire the cathode-ray tube, which accounts for most of the bulk of the conventional TV set. Replacing the cathode-ray tube with a large, thin screen is the key to the creation of a high-definition television, or HDTV, which is expected to become a $ 30 billion business world-wide within a decade. Large U.S. companies are interested in other segments of the HDTV business, such as signal-processing and broadcast equipment. But except for Zenith Electronics Corp. and International Business Machines Corp., which is collaborating with Toshiba on computer displays, they are poorly positioned to exploit advances in large panels. General Electric Co. recently sold off its interests in liquid-crystal displays to Thompson-CSF of France. "We found the market not developing as we thought it would," a GE spokesman says.  :: true
Thus far, almost all of the basic technology relating to high-definition television has come from U.S. laboratories. But Peter Brody, Magnascreen's president, says Japanese companies are poised to snatch the technology and put it to commercial use, just as they did with earlier U.S. innovations in color television and video recording.  :: true
And they will again, say money-manager proponents of the growth-stock theme. Cabanne Smith, president of a money management company bearing his name, predicts that investment companies using computers to identify companies with earnings "momentum " will climb on the growth-stock bandwagon as the overall corporate earnings outlook deteriorates further. He also thinks foreign investors, who are showing signs of more discriminate investing, will join the pursuit and pump up prices.  :: true

We badly need to follow fact rather than the rhetoric of conventional wisdom. Without this basic level of attention to reality, our policies on Cuba will continue to be as counterproductive as they have for 30 years. From my own point of view, given the qualities of humanity, creativity and warm spirit in which the Cuban people excel, we deny ourselves access to things we hold dear, and which seem to run in such short supply these days. There is no rational justification for such behavior.  :: true
What this all means in shorthand is that Soviet dominance in Ethiopia is collapsing as fast as President Barre's regime in Somalia is. The U.S., therefore, has a historic opportunity both to strike a blow for human rights in Somalia and to undo the superpower flip-flop of the late 1970s on the Horn of Africa.  :: true
Under that approach, countries with the most unused oil capacity would get bigger shares of any future increases in OPEC's production ceiling than they would under the current system.

One-Cancels-The-Other Order : This is really two orders in one, generally for the same security or commodity, instructing floor brokers to fill whichever order they can first and then cancel the other order.

But while history can suggest what is reasonable to expect there's no guarantee that the past will repeat itself. For instance, some analysts believe bond returns and volatility have moved permanently closer to those of the stock market. And returns on cash investments may continue to exceed inflation by a wider margin than they did over the long-term past.  :: true
With this personal strategy firmly in place, I look forward to years of fine life-style investments and increasing widespread leverage. My kids' college education looms as perhaps the greatest future opportunity for spending, although I'll probably have to cash in their toy portfolio to take advantage of it. But with every step I take, I'm building wealth. You can, too, if you, like me, refuse to bite the bullet. So go out there and eat that debt. You're right there in the mainstream of American business, building value on the back of insupportable expenditures. Henry Kravis, watch out !  :: true
So do just about all the losses that could be attributed to the sheer incompetence of unqualified planners. Nobody can estimate the toll, but John Gargan, a Tampa, Fla., planner and head of one trade group, the International Association of Registered Financial Planners, thinks the danger to investors from incompetence is "humongous," far greater than that from crookery. His group, like others, wants minimum standards applied to all who call themselves financial planners.  :: true
Other cases go to show that an old saw still applies : If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Certificates of deposit don't pay 23 % a year, for example, but that didn't give pause to clients of one Alabama planner. Now they're losers and he's in jail in Mobile County. CDs yielding 40 % are even more implausible -- especially when the issuing "bank " in the Marshall Islands is merely a mail drop watched over by a local gas-station operator -- but investors fell for that one too.  :: true
It never hurt anyone, that is, unless the growth funds don't grow when you need them to. Or the zero-coupon bonds turn out not to have been discounted deeply enough to pay your kid's tuition. That's the dilemma for today's parent. Although many experts are advising risk, no one has a good answer for you if the risk doesn't pay off.  :: true
The issue here may be the soundness of the guarantee. Prepayments, much like mutual-fund purchases, are pooled for investment. Sponsors are naturally counting on their ability to keep ahead of tuition inflation with investment returns. But buyers are essentially betting on a start-up investment fund with no track record -- and some have been encouraged to borrow to do so.  :: true
The number of misclassified workers may be in the millions, mostly paid by small firms. Many workers, especially professionals, want to remain independent to avoid tax withholding and to continue to deduct many expenses that employees can't. But many others, who want to qualify for employee benefits and unemployment compensation, become tipsters for the IRS, says Jerry Lackey, who manages the IRS project's force of nine agents in north and central Florida from Orlando. Firms that are paying employment taxes also provide leads to competitors that aren't, he says.  :: true

Revenue-short states also are becoming more aggressive pursuers of tax delinquents, and perhaps none tracks them down with more relish than does New York since it acquired an $ 80 million computer system in 1985. The state's tax enforcers have amassed data bases from other New York agencies that license or register professionals and businesses ; from exchange agreements with the IRS, 24 other states, and two Canadian provinces, and even from phonebook Yellow Pages. Thus armed for massive matching of documents by computer, they single out high-income groups, looking primarily for people who haven't filed New York income-tax returns.  :: true
One of the plan's authors has defended the "socioeconomic disadvantage " category as perhaps making more sense than the current affirmative-action preferences based on race. Perhaps it does.

Amex said it would charge me $ 576 a year for $100,000 of coverage -- and would pay me back all the premiums I put in if I canceled the policy after 10 years. Sounds great -- or does it ?  :: true
Third and most important, Amex would charge me a far higher premium than other reputable companies would on a straight term policy for the same amount ; I'd be paying so heavily just to have the option of getting my premiums back that I'd almost have to cancel to make the whole thing worthwhile. That would be all right with Amex, which could then lock in its investment profit, but it doesn't add up to a "smart money " move for me.  :: true
Congress closed this loophole last year, or thought it did. However, Monarch Capital Corp. of Springfield, Mass., has developed a "combination plan " of annuity and insurance coverage that it says does not violate the new regulations and that allows policy loans without tax consequences.

Companies "n't comfortable playing these games, but they realize they're under pressure to make their policies look good," says Timothy Pfiefer, an actuarial consultant at Tillinghast, a unit of Towers Perrin Co., the big New York consulting firm.

Things were supposed to change when Vietnam's economic reforms gathered pace, and for awhile they did. After years of experimenting, Mr. Chan produced a heavy-duty bicycle tire that outlasted its state-produced rival. By 1982, he was selling thousands of tires.

Here in the Global Village, though, folks do not stay uninformed for long. Electrical power was out in still-daylighted Candlestick Park, but battery-operated radios and television sets were plentiful. Within a few minutes, the true extent of the catastrophe was becoming clear. Its Richter Scale measurement was reported as 6.5, then 6.9, then 7.0.

Its language -- call it Streetspeak -- is increasingly mellifluous, reassuring, and designed to make financial products and maneuvers appear better, safer or cheaper than they really are.

Traditional no-loads made their money by charging an annual management fee, usually a modest one ; they imposed no other fees, and many still don't. In recent years, though, a passel of others flying the no-load flag have been imposing hefty charges -- all the way up to 6 % -- when an investor sells his shares. Shouldn't they properly be called exit-load funds ? The mutual-fund industry is debating the question, but don't expect a new name while the old one is working so well.  :: true
And don't expect anyone to change the term "blue chip," either, even though some of the companies that still enjoy the title may be riskier investments than they were. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., for one, is still a favorite of widows, orphans and trust departments -- but shorn of its regional telephone units and exposed to competition on every side, it is a far different investment prospect than it was before divestiture.  :: true
Mr. Daly in his affidavit acknowledges that Warner agreed to release the producers last year to take over MGM but says that situation was altogether different. For one thing, according to Mr. Daly, the producers requested a release in advance. Moreover, the old contract was about to expire, and the lineup of Guber Peters pictures for Warner wasn't as strong as it is now. Warner itself was in negotiations with MGM over certain movie and other rights, and it was " Warner's interest to accommodate MGM\, Guber and Peters by permitting them to become MGM executives," Mr. Daly said in his affidavit.  :: true

"I'm too old to waste a weekend, but that's what I did," the 48-year-old Mr. Juliano moans. "These days, anything can happen." :: true
Now Robert Parker, author of several best sellers featuring Spenser, a contemporary private eye in the Marlowe mold, has with the blessings of the Chandler estate been hired to complete "The Poodle Springs Story." The result, "Poodle Springs " ( Putnam's, 288 pages, $ 18.95 ) is an entertaining, easy to read and fairly graceful extension of the Marlowe chronicle, full of hard-boiled wisecracks and California color. If it does not quite have Chandler's special magic -- well, at the end, neither did Chandler.  :: true
The individual foreign policy carried out by U.S. legislators adds to a confusing U.S. performance that has emboldened Soviet initiatives in Central America. On Oct. 3, following conversations with Secretary of State James Baker, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze arrived in Managua to acclaim "Nicaragua's great peace efforts." There, Mr. Shevardnadze felt legitimized to unveil his own peace plan : The U.S.S.R. would prolong a suspension of arms shipments to Nicaragua after the February election if the U.S. did likewise with its allies in Central America. He also called on Nicaragua's neighbors to accept a "military equilibrium " guaranteed by both superpowers. The Pentagon claims that in spite of Moscow's words, East bloc weapons continue to flow into Nicaragua through Cuba at near-record levels.  :: true
Pinpoint Information Corp., Chantilly, Va., a producer of $1,800-a-year personalized newsletters about the computer industry that started full operation last month, relies on 12 human readers to code news releases by topic in order to select items for each subscriber.

While this theory is exceedingly simple, it appears to explain several things. First, why ticket splitting has increased and taken the peculiar pattern that it has over the past half century : Prior to the election of Franklin Roosevelt as president and the advent of the New Deal, government occupied a much smaller role in society and the prisoner's dilemma problem confronting voters in races for Congress was considerably less severe.  :: true
Second, it explains why voters hold Congress in disdain but generally love their own congressional representatives : Any individual legislator's constituents appreciate the specific benefits that the legislator wins for them but not the overall cost associated with every other legislator doing likewise for his own constituency.  :: true
Today a President can still send up spending rescissions, but they're meaningless unless Congress has a guilty conscience and changes its mind. This is like asking foxes to feel remorse about chickens, and naturally rescissions are almost never approved. In 1987, President Reagan sent 73 rescissions back to the Hill, but only 3 % of the spending total was approved by Congress. Senator Coats's proposal would let the proposed spending cuts take place automatically unless Congress acts. The Members could still try to serve their constituents with special-interest goodies, but the police ( in the form of a President ) would be there with a straitjacket if they really get crazy, as they do now.  :: true
A program called Notes, which is under development by Lotus, also is designed to sort E-mail sent within work groups. One thing that makes E-mail difficult to sift through is that each item looks the same. Notes, which is designed for advanced computers that display graphics, allows mail senders to put different logos on their mail. A daily news briefing from the company librarian, for example, would have a distinctive format on the screen, just as a paper version would have.  :: true
The reason is simple, Mr. Wyss says : "Interest rates almost always decline during recession." As surely as a seesaw tilts, falling interest rates force up the price of previously issued bonds. They are worth more because they pay higher interest than newly issued bonds do.  :: true
Mr. Peters, on the other hand, has fewer fans in Hollywood, and his detractors like to characterize him as something of a hot-tempered bully. He gets better reviews as a creative whiz, an enthusiast, an idea man. He also had to fight harder for credibility than his partner did. Barbra Streisand made him famous. He cut her hair. He lived with her. He came to produce her records and her movies -- "A Star Is Born " and "The Main Event."  :: true
As we know, voters tend to favor Republicans more in races for president than in those for Congress. In every presidential election over the past half century, except for the Goldwater presidential candidacy, the GOP has captured a greater percentage of the major-party popular vote for president than it has of congressional seats or the popular vote for Congress. Prior to 1932, the pattern was nearly the opposite.  :: true
Is there any empirical support for this theory ? Three pieces of evidence corroborate the key assumption that Democratic legislators are more willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Republican colleagues. First, economists James Bennett and Thomas DiLorenzo find that GOP senators turn back roughly 10 % more of their allocated personal staff budgets than Democrats do. To the extent that the primary duty of personal staff involves local benefit-seeking, this indicates that political philosophy leads congressional Republicans to pay less attention to narrow constituent concerns.  :: true
Second, if the key assumption is valid, Democrats should have lower attendance rates on roll-call votes than Republicans do to the extent that such votes reflect national policy making and that participating in such votes takes away from the time a legislator could otherwise devote to local benefit-seeking. This is indeed what the data indicate, particularly in the case of the House. The Democratic House attendance rate has not exceeded the Republican House attendance rate since 1959.  :: true
Moreover, ticket splitting appears to take the same peculiar pattern at the state government level as it does at the federal level. State government is more typically split along Republican-governor\ lines than the reverse. A cross-state econometric investigation, furthermore, reveals that, holding other factors constant, the difference between a state's major-party vote going to the Republican gubernatorial candidate and the Republican share of the lower state house is a positive function of the state tax rate.  :: true
What complicates the scene in Cambodia is that the current regime is already communist, as are its Vietnamese overseers back in Hanoi, as are the Khmer Rouge -- who are the strongest of the three guerrilla groups.

He's got a wife and two kids and a house in the suburbs ; the audience sees only the house, and only near the end of the movie.

Sassy already has recovered ; circulation has quickly passed the500,000 mark and advertising pages have stabilized this year at more than 300. What's more, Mr. Lang says he has what all publishers wish for : a bona fide niche. "Seventeen is written more for mothers, not their daughters," said Mr. Lang. " Sassy has a different spirit. It gets more mail in a month than McCall's got in a year, and it's not from mothers. I feel about Sassy like I did about Working Woman 10 years ago." Mr. Lang took on Ms. and Sassy with the acquisition of Matilda Publications Inc. by his newly formed Lang Communications.

The problem is one that East Germany shares with other half-states, such as North Korea, but one it must shoulder alone in the East Bloc. When Poland moves to reform, it can at least lean on its past : However flawed and short-lived Joseph Pilsudski's interwar republic, it was a nonsocialist democracy. Czech reformers can recall the Wilsonian ideals of the same period in their country. Even the Soviet Union has Peter the Great to rediscover, should it choose to. But East Germany is merely "the land of truly existing socialism." Beyond that, it has to compete with West Germany for a claim to the German identity. Up to now, the main weapon of the "worker and peasant state " has been the ideology of socialism.  :: true
SUGAR : Futures prices extended Tuesday's gains. The March delivery ended with an advance of 0.16 cent a pound to 14.27 cents, for a two-day gain of 0.3 cent. According to one dealer, Japan said it has only40,000 tons of sugar remaining to be shipped to it this year by Cuba under current commitments. The announcement was made because of reports Tuesday that Cuba would delay shipments to Japan scheduled for later this year, into early next year. The dealer said the quantity mentioned in the Japanese announcement is so small that it's meaningless. One analyst said he thought the market continued to be supported to some degree by a delay in the Cuban sugar harvest caused by adverse weather. The dealer said India might be the real factor that is keeping futures prices firm. That country recently bought200,000 tons of sugar and had been expected to seek a like quantity last week but didn't. "It's known they need the sugar, and the expectation that they will come in is apparently giving the market its principal support," the dealer said.  :: true

Some American officers interpreted his eagerness and studiousness as a sign of loyalty, but they did so falsely. He rose to chief of intelligence in Panama's socalled G-2 in 1970 after providing populist dictator Torrijos the critical support to defeat a coup attempt against him a year earlier. He became Gen. Torrijos's inseparable shadow, and the holder of all Panama's secrets. Mr. Noriega, by now a lieutenant colonel, expanded his contacts to include the Cubans -- not to mention the Israelis, the Taiwanese and any other intelligence service that came knocking. When U.S. diplomats complained to the CIA of Col. Noriega's moonlighting, intelligence experts always insisted that his allegiance was first to the Americans.  :: true
As Mr. Noriega's political troubles grew, so did his offers of assistance to the Contras, an apparent attempt to curry more favor in Washington.

With the February 1987 U.N. accords " to Afghanistan," the Soviet Union got everything it needed to consolidate permanent control. The terms of the Geneva accords leave Moscow free to provide its clients in Kabul with assistance of any kind -- including the return of Soviet ground forces -- while requiring the U.S. and Pakistan to cut off aid. The only fly in the Soviet ointment was the last-minute addition of a unilateral American caveat, that U.S. aid to the resistance would continue as long as Soviet aid to Kabul did. But as soon as the accords were signed, American officials sharply reduced aid. In February 1989, when the Soviets said they had completed their pullout, the U.S. cut it further.  :: true

But now, the magazine is attempting to fight back, with an ambitious plan including a revamped sales strategy and a surprisingly aggressive ad campaign. Advertisers don't think of the magazine first, says Joan McCraw, who joined in April as national advertising director. "What we want to do is take a more aggressive stance.

The magazine had its best year yet in 1988, when it celebrated its centennial and racked up a 17 % gain in ad pages, to 283. But this year, when the hullabaloo surrounding its centennial died, so too did some advertiser interest. The reason, ad executives say, is that the entire magazine business has been soft -- and National Geographic has some quirks that make it especially unattractive during a soft market.  :: true
Another sticking point for advertisers was National Geographic's tradition of lumping its ads together, usually at the beginning or end of the magazine, rather than spreading ads out among its articles, as most magazines do National Geographic's smaller-than-average size means extra production costs for advertisers.  :: true

That's about all it costs to appease Adm. Erich Raeder's ghost. In 1941, Raeder and the German navy threatened to attack the Panama Canal, so we created the Southern Command in Panama. The Southern Command has grown even bigger since the war because Raeder's ghost sometimes runs through the E ring dressed like Gen. Noriega. The Command's huge bureaucracy is needed to analyze whether leaders of coups against Gen.

Despite his racial advantage, to be a great butler is a heroic calling ; one's pantry is " unlike general's headquarters during a battle." If, for example, in the midst of a great social occasion ( such as an international conference on revising the Versailles Treaty in 1923 ), one's 72-yearold father, himself a great butler once, should happen to die of a stroke, one must continue to serve the port : " don't think me unduly improper in not ascending to see my father in his deceased condition just at this moment. You see, I know my father would have wished me to carry on just now." It is this kind of dignity and restraint that allows Stevens to declare : " all its sad associations, whenever I recall that evening today, I find I do so with a large sense of triumph." We note the imperial public word used to deny private rage and sorrow. That Stevens himself is not grotesque or repellent, but funny and sad and enlightening, is entirely the author's triumph.  :: true
It turns out Mr. Friend's client, Machelle Parks of Cincinnati, didn't like the way defense attorney Tom Alexander acted during the legal proceedings.

First to suffer from the spending cuts will be programs that spend most of their money on personnel, Mr. Darman said. He wouldn't predict how long it would be before the first layoffs, if any, occur. Under the law, President Bush may exempt military personnel accounts from the spending cuts. He hasn't yet done so.

In any case, the brokerage firms are clearly moving faster to create new ads than they did in the fall of 1987. But it remains to be seen whether their ads will be any more effective.

Then, to make matters worse, computerized sell programs kicked in, hammering stocks into steeper losses. There was heavy stock-index arbitrage, as traders sold big baskets of stock and bought stock-index futures to profit from the price discrepancies between the two markets. This was a hangover from Friday, when Standard & Poor's 500-stock index futures had closed at a sharp discount to stocks. The onslaught of the program selling dashed any hopes that some of the big program trading firms would hold off until the market stabilized. They didn't. The Dow accelerated its slide, losing 63.52 in the first 40 minutes of trading.  :: true
Meanwhile, Peter DaPuzzo, Shearson's head of retail equity trading, praised institutional investors in the OTC market, who were heavy buyers of the Nasdaq's biggest technology issues yesterday amid a flood of selling by other investors. "The institutions can't be criticized for their behavior," Mr. DaPuzzo said in an interview. "It was the opposite of what happened on Oct. 19. They used their judgment. They didn't panic during the first round of selling this morning. Instead, they bought on weakness and sold into the strength, which kept the market orderly. Maybe they learned from experience."  :: true
Then at 10:15 the Dow suddenly started to rebound, and when it shot upward it did so even faster than the early-morning fall. And this time, it wasn't just the program traders who were responsible. All the selling had pushed stocks to such cheap values that big investment banks and major money management firms started buying stocks heavily. The program traders were in there, too, of course. But according to one trader, the programmers "n't look as dominant on the upside as on the downside because there was { also } a lot of bargain-hunting " by institutions.  :: true

Congress has been critical of the Bush administration for not sending enough aid to Poland, so it is getting ready to send its own version of a CARE package. Last month, the Senate voted to send a delegation of congressional staffers to Poland to assist its legislature, the Sejm, in democratic procedures. Senator Pete Domenici calls this effort "the first gift of democracy." The Poles might do better to view it as a Trojan Horse. It is the vast shadow government of15,000 congressional staffers that helps create such legislative atrocities as the1,376 page, 13-pound reconciliation bill that claimed to be the budget of the United States. Maybe after the staffers explain their work to the Poles, they'd be willing to come back and do the same for the American people.  :: true
COPPER : Futures prices fell and showed little rebound as one major labor problem that had been underpinning prices appeared to be solved. The December contract declined 3.05 cents a pound to $ 1.2745. Prices were down from the outset of trading on concern that a drop in the stock market might create a weakened economy and a consequent reduction in copper use. But the recovery in the stock market provided little help for copper as word spread that a three-month strike at the Highland Valley mine in British Columbia was about over, according to an analyst. Highland Valley is a large Canadian producer and principal supplier to Japan, which recently began seeking copper elsewhere as its inventories shrank. Last week it was reported that company and union negotiations had overcome the major hurdle, the contracting out of work by the company. Now, the analyst said, only minor points remain to be cleaned up. " all intents and purposes, an agreement appears to have been achieved," he said. Copper inventories in New York's Commodity Exchange warehouses rose yesterday by 516 tons, to10,004 tons. London Metal Exchange copper inventories last week declined13,575 tons, to89,300 tons. The LME stocks decline was about as expected, but the Comex gain wasn't. However, this was brushed aside by concern over the stock market, the analyst said. At one point in futures trading, as the stock market firmed, the December contract rose to as high as $ 1.2965, but it wasn't able to sustain the gain. "It was simply overbought," he said, and selling by funds that are computer guided helped depress prices.  :: true

Despite a decade-long attempt to revamp the socialist economy, China's mega-welfare state is alive and well. Health care is free, housing costs just pennies and food is heavily subsidized. At Panzhihua, as in other big state-run factories, workers still can count on a cradle-to-grave safety net. Factory officials estimate that more than 10 % of the work force here is redundant, but layoffs aren't allowed. Even factory workers' children are guaranteed jobs. The industrial monoliths are so deeply involved in the welfare system that China's leaders may never be able to modernize them, despite their glaring economic inefficiency. Though the Panzhihua factory itself is profitable, many such enterprises aren't. Subsidies for money-losing enterprises totaled $ 18 billion last year, or about one-third the total state revenue.  :: true
What keeps Mr. Li in Panzhihua ? Partly the system. While workers can't easily be fired, they also can't easily quit to find jobs elsewhere. The Li family could apply for permission to do so, but hasn't tried. "I expect I'll be in Panzhihua for the rest of my life," Mr. Li says. "The No. 1 high school is pretty good, and I have to think of my daughter's future."  :: true
The Fed allowed the key federal funds interest rate to dip to about 8 5\ % from its levels of just below 9 % last week. That was a sign to financial markets that, at least for now, the Fed was easing its grip on credit. Because the markets remained relatively calm, however, the Fed didn't have to inject massive amounts of money into the banking system, as it did in October 1987.  :: true
"I do not regard the amount of the decline on Friday as unexpected or unlikely," he said in a telephone interview. " the market being up to2,700 or2,800 and the existence of derivative products... one can expect volatility of the magnitude we had."  :: true
Those sound like innocuous changes, but they're not. Both the Treasury and Congress traditionally have pushed for easy money, the Treasury to reduce its debt management problems and Congress to satisfy powerful producer constituencies who want a weak dollar for short-term competitive gains in world markets. Congressional pressures on the Fed similar to those that produced the savings and loan mess are an awful thought.  :: true
Easy money advocates, however, are adept at spreading economic myths. There is the constant insistence that the Fed could lower interest rates were it not so obstinate. The Fed indeed can lower short-term interest rates by pumping reserves into the banks, but it can't do much about them from there on. If the reserves generate inflation, which is what the Fed fears most right now, interest rates will go up as lenders demand a premium. Enough inflation can ultimately even wipe out the bond market, as it did in Britain in the 1970s, thereby crippling the economy.  :: true
These two myths have caused the republic untold damage. The U.S. economy took on an inflationary bias when the Fed was forced to finance an incredible spending spree by Lyndon Johnson. Richard Nixon exacerbated the problem when, in response to pressures from Congress, he applied price and wage controls in August 1971, thereby discouraging production. Jimmy Carter ultimately hired Mr. Volcker to kill inflation, which was reaching dangerous levels. He did, too late to save Mr. Carter from forced retirement.  :: true
The claim that inflation generates economic growth is seductive. In fact it does the opposite. As the charts show, the 1975-80 inflation destroyed both productivity and economic growth ( see accompanying charts -- WSJ Oct. 17, 1989 ). It was only after Mr. Volcker killed inflation, at the cost of a sharp but brief recession, that growth and productivity started rising once more. Producers were forced by the discipline of sound money to slash away organizational fat and acquire more efficient equipment. After having performed that admirable feat, however, they were back in 1985 demanding a dollar devaluation that would make it still easier for them to compete in international markets. They got the devaluation and, as is usually the case, began picking up fat again. So now they want another one.  :: true
Authorities, including the Bank of England and the Securities Association, are gearing up in case a crisis wallops the London market. The bank was in touch with other major central banks over the weekend and was preparing to make capital available to dealers if needed, as it did in the 1987 crash, according to people familiar with the bank's strategy.  :: true
Many are quick to emphasize that just because the market can fall as fast as it did Friday doesn't mean it will tank again, despite some disquieting similarities between now and October 1987. As in 1987, this latest market slide was preceded by sparring between nations and government officials over the dollar.  :: true
If foreigners dump U.S. stocks and return to the safety of their home markets -- as they did in October 1987 -- they must simultaneously also sell dollars for their own currencies. Those transactions, in turn, could weaken the dollar. Even if foreigners just withhold from buying additional U.S. securities, they reduce the demand for dollars.  :: true
America West, though, is a smaller airline and therefore more affected by the delayed delivery of a single plane than many of its competitors would be. "I figure that American and United probably have such a hard time counting all the planes in their fleets, they might not miss one at all," Mr. Otradovec said.  :: true
Major oil companies in the next few days are expected to report much less robust earnings than they did for the third quarter a year ago, largely reflecting deteriorating chemical prices and gasoline profitability. The gasoline picture may improve this quarter, but chemicals are likely to remain weak, industry executives and analysts say, reducing chances that profits could equal their year-earlier performance.  :: true
But securities analysts say Phillips will be among the companies hard-hit by weak chemical prices and will probably post a drop in third-quarter earnings. So, too, many analysts predict, will Exxon Corp., Chevron Corp. and Amoco Corp.  :: true
"It hasn't had any impact on us, nor do we expect it to," said a spokeswoman for Miller Brewing Co., a major client of Backer Spielvogel. John Lampe, director of advertising at PaineWebber Inc., a Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising client, said : "We have no problem with the announcement, because we don't know what change it's going to bring about. We aren't going to change agencies because of a change in London."  :: true
The Bronx has a wonderful botanical garden, a great zoo, its own charming Little Italy ( on Arthur Avenue ) and, of course, the Yankees. However, most people, having been subjected to news footage of the devastated South Bronx, look at the borough the way Tom Wolfe's Sherman McCoy did in "Bonfire of the Vanities " -- as a wrong turn into hell.  :: true
Then there's "The World Today," the prime-time newscast featuring Mr. Shaw and Ms. Crier. Until now, CNN has featured its Hollywood gossip show during the key evening period. But 70 % of the cable-television-equipped households that watch news do so between 6:30 p.m. and 7 p.m., the network discovered, so CNN wants in. Mr. Amos says the Shaw-Crier team will probably do two live interviews a day, with most of the program, at least for now, appearing similar to CNN's other newcasts.  :: true
While some in the U.S. contend that advertising is the bane of television, here many believe that its absence is to blame for the European TV industry's sluggish development. Until recently, national governments in Europe controlled most of the air time and allowed little or no advertising. Since production costs were guaranteed, it didn't matter that a program couldn't be sold abroad or put into syndication, as most American programs are. But not much money was spent on the shows, either, a situation that encouraged cheap-to-make talk and game shows, while discouraging expensive-to-produce dramas.  :: true
IOWA IS MAKING a comeback. So are Indiana, Ohio and Michigan. The population of all four states is on the upswing, according to new Census Bureau estimates, following declines throughout the early 1980s.  :: true
If Mr. Mason had used less derogatory language to articulate his amateur analysis of the voting behavior of his fellow New Yorkers, would the water be quite so hot ? It probably would, because few or none of the people upset by Mr. Mason's remarks have bothered to distinguish between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used insulting language. In addition, some of Mr. Mason's critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of racism.  :: true
Don't say the TV sitcom, because that happens to be a genre that, in its desperate need to attract everybody and offend nobody, resembles politics more than it does comedy. It is true that the best sitcoms do allow group differences to simmer : yuppies vs. blue-collar Bostonians in "Cheers " ; children vs. adults in "The Cosby Show." But these are not the differences that make headlines.  :: true
In "Chicken Soup," Mr. Mason plays Jackie, a Jewish bachelor courting Maddie ( Lynn Redgrave ), an Irish widow and mother of three, against the wishes of his mother ( Rita Karin ) and her brother Michael ( Brandon Maggart ). It's worth noting that both disapproving relatives are immigrants. At least, they both speak with strong accents, as do Jackie and Maddie. It couldn't be more obvious that "Chicken Soup " is being made from an old recipe. And a safe one -- imagine if the romance in question were between an Orthodox Jew and a member of the Nation of Islam.  :: true
Yes, he did. As I watched him on C-Span, I heard him speak those lovely words about the Bill of Rights, which he quotes from the transcript of the hearings. He did repeat those nice platitudes several times as an indication of his support for the Constitution. He used about 56 words defending the witnesses' constitutional rights.  :: true
Market makers keep supplies of stock on hand to maintain orderly trading when imbalances occur. On days like Friday, that means they must buy shares from sellers when no one else is willing to. When selling is so frenzied, prices fall steeply and fast. Two years ago, faced with the possibility of heavy losses on the stocks in their inventories, market makers themselves began dumping shares, exacerbating the slide in OTC stock prices.  :: true
"There are some very significant issues out there, such as the fiscal deficit, the trade deficit, our relations with Japan, that have to be the subject of major initiatives," he said in an interview. "I'd like to see that initiative, and I haven't. There isn't a big shot, an agenda."  :: true
Surveys suggested that consumer confidence was high before Friday. A 190-point drop isn't likely to make much of a dent ; multiply that a few times over, though, and it will. If the reactions of executives gathered Saturday at Hot Springs, Va., for the Business Council meetings are typical, business leaders weren't overly rattled by Friday's decline. And if foreign investors become a tad more cautious -- well, the dollar's recent strength suggests that the U.S. can stand it.  :: true
A rebound in energy prices, which helped push up the producer price index, is expected to do the same in the consumer price report. The consensus view expects a 0.4 % increase in the September CPI after a flat reading in August.  :: true
Robert H. Chandross, an economist for Lloyd's Bank in New York, is among those expecting a more moderate gain in the CPI than in prices at the producer level. "Auto prices had a big effect in the PPI, and at the CPI level they won't," he said.  :: true
While the network currently can operate freely in Budapest, so can others. In addition, competition for listeners is getting tougher in many ways than when broadcasting here was strictly controlled. Instead of being denounced as an evil agent of imperialism, Radio Free Europe is more likely to draw the criticism that its programs are too tame, even boring.  :: true
What is one to think of all this ? Doctrine and special interests govern some responses. People eager to have youth " their dues to society " favor service proposals -- preferably mandatory ones. So do those who seek a "re-energized concept of citizenship," a concept imposing stern obligations as well as conferring rights. Then there are instinctive opponents. To libertarians, mandatory service is an abomination and voluntary systems are illegitimate uses of tax money. Devotees of the market question the value of the work national service would perform : If the market won't pay for it, they argue, it can't be worth its cost. Elements of the left are also reflexively opposed ; they see service as a cover for the draft, or fear the regimentation of youth, or want to see rights enlarged, not obligations.  :: true
Good service programs require recruitment, screening, training and supervision -- all of high quality. They involve stipends to participants. Full-time residential programs also require housing and full-time supervision ; they are particularly expensive -- more per participant than a year at Stanford or Yale. Non-residential programs are cheaper, but good ones still come to some $10,000 a year. Are they worth that ? Evaluations suggest that good ones are -- especially so if the effects on participants are counted. But the calculations are challengeable.  :: true
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was on the telephones, making it clear to officials in the U.S. and abroad that the Fed was prepared to inject massive amounts of money into the banking system, as it did in October 1987, if the action were needed to prevent a financial crisis.  :: true
Sony found a new market niche, but Mr. Kaye figured that its prices left plenty of room for a lower-priced competitor. His products aren't exact copies of Sony's but strongly resemble them in size, shape and, especially, color. Sony uses mostly red and blue, with traces of yellow -- and so does Justin, on the theory that kids prefer these colors. ( " be successful, a product can be any color whatsoever, as long as it is fire-engine red," says Charles E. Baxley, Justin's attorney. )  :: true
Now, dozens of corporations, including Ethan Allen, TW Services and York International, that are counting on at least $ 7 billion of scheduled new junk financings to keep their highly leveraged takeovers and buy-outs afloat, may never get the money. "The music has stopped playing," says Michael Harkins, a principal in the investment firm of Levy Harkins. "You've either got a chair or you don't."  :: true
Ramada, which first delayed and then shelved a $ 400 million junk bond sale that was designed to help finance a restructuring, fell 15.6 % to close at 9 1\. Ramada has said it hopes to propose a new restructuring plan but hasn't indicated when it will do so.  :: true
But the stock market as a whole, bolstered as it is by takeover speculation, remains vulnerable to any further pullback by takeover financiers, both in the junkbond market and among commercial banks. For debt-ridden suitors, "the takeover game has been over for some time," says New York money manager Neil Weisman of Chilmark Capital, who has been keeping 85 % of his portfolio in cash. "The market is just waking up to that point."  :: true
Mr. Wertheimer said the Senate Ethics Committee should hire a special outside counsel to conduct an investigation, as was done in the case of former House Speaker James Wright. Wilson Abney, staff director of the ethics panel, wouldn't comment.  :: true

As the days go by, the South African government will be ever more hard pressed to justify the continued imprisonment of Mr. Mandela as well as the continued banning of the ANC and enforcement of the state of emergency. If it doesn't yield on these matters, and eventually begin talking directly to the ANC, the expectations and promise raised by yesterday's releases will turn to disillusionment and unrest. If it does, the large number of right-wing whites, who oppose any concessions to the black majority, will step up their agitation and threats to take matters into their own hands.  :: true
South Korea is " important to us now, both economically and in terms of security," says Sen. Richard Lugar ( R., Ind. ), the former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ", many Americans don't think much about Korea. But the miracle of their economic growth and the development of democracy -- imperfect though it is -- are very important to the United States." One major topic during Mr. Roh's visit will be human rights. Due process still is denied in South Korea ; a few months ago, Kim Dae Jung, the major opposition leader, was detained and interrogated for 20 hours by security thugs. Just as Pope John Paul II did in Seoul last week, President Bush and members of Congress ought to tell Mr. Roh in no uncertain terms that this kind of behavior is unacceptable.  :: true
It's appropriate for U.S. officials to keep hammering for more open trade policies, as U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills did in Seoul last week. But there's also sometimes a tendency in American political circles to pick especially on South Korea, out of frustration over our inability to do much about Japan. That's counterproductive.  :: true
Still, such a pricing strategy just might appeal to people like Connie Bates, a respondent in the Journal survey. She recently walked out of a furniture store because the salesman offered to cut the price of a sectional couch three times. When a store keeps dropping prices, the Farmington, Mich., resident says, "I get suspicious that they're trying to get the most they can out of you."  :: true
Recent order rates indicate that the fourth quarter, a time shipments usually pick up, will be weak as well. Merrill Lynch's Mr. Bradford said, "We haven't seen the pickup in flat rolled orders that we should have." Flat rolled steel is the industry's major product.  :: true
But now, with Bull in firm control, these U.S. operations are key ingredients in Mr. Lorentz's plans to ensure that Bull remains one of the half-dozen or so world-wide, full-range computer companies likely to survive the 1990s. To do so, Bull is planting itself firmly in the U.S., where, says Mr. Lorentz, a lot of the best people and research are. The Zenith buy means Bull will derive 22 % of its revenue from the U.S. -- up from 18 % previously -- and the company spends 30 % of its 3.64 billion-franc research and development budget in the U.S.  :: true
" " through the Beijing massacre ? This is the buzzword Adi Ignatius chooses to characterize in his review of my book "Tiananmen Diary : Thirteen Days in June " ( Leisire & Arts, Sept. 8 ). I doubt that many readers of this chronicle of the blood and bullets and terror of the Beijing massacre would put it just this way. Nor mistake, as he seems to have done, a raw, rough-cut, unretouched, genuine diary, complete with blips, print lice and all the confusions of real time with high-gloss footnoted academic scholarship. Such works will be forthcoming, but I doubt if they will convey the anguish of what Mr. Ignatius calls my "insta-book."  :: true

Purchased by the Portsmouth and South East Hampshire Area Health Authority, the building will be home to two other AIDS charities. :: false
The team is caring for growing numbers ill on the South Coast, including Brighton. :: false
The 24-page full colour schools booklet "HIV - It's Your Choice" is now available to members of the public at a price of 50p each. :: false
Last year ACET educators saw 24,500 pupils in face to face presentations. :: false
The ACET Conference in May at the Ealing YMCA was well attended by both staff and volunteers from London, the South East, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Romania and Uganda. :: false
UK Director and organiser of the Conference, Peter Johnson, said, "For many, the day provided a reaffirmation of the vision for ACET and a marvellous sense of unity." :: false
Three visitors from Frankfurt, Germany, recently visited ACET's offices before returning home to begin a similar service, Christian AIDS Help (CAH). :: false
Interest was expressed in all of the organisational aspects of home care including nursing, equipment loans and the volunteer programme. :: false
Like ACET, CAH will give both medical and practical help to AIDS patients in the home. :: false
Letters would be welcome. :: false
Any contributions may be edited. :: false
As the number of people ill with AIDS increases so does the need for volunteers to care for them. :: false
Over the last three years, our volunteers have provided much love and care to many hurt and lonely people. :: false
The support our volunteers provide cannot be measured in purely practical terms and their continuing contribution is vital if we are to provide an ongoing service. :: false
In recognition of their importance and the need to train more volunteers, we want to develop links with individual churches. :: false
To do this, we would like to recruit people who are willing to be an ACET-link in their church. :: false
An ACET-link person, possibly an existing volunteer, would keep their church informed about our work and encourage people to consider becoming volunteers, help with fundraising ideas and circulate newsletters. :: false
An ACET-link will play a vital role as our work is growing so rapidly. :: false
Anthony Kasozi's work as ACET's Director in uganda has recently received financial support form Tear Fund which has enabled him, together with ACET General Manager, Maurice Adams, to identify a number of church-based projects for the coming year. :: false
Returning from a visit to Uganda, where he met with patients in the villages and with other agencies, Maurice Adams said, "It is a beautiful country which is being devastated by a disease which can be stopped." :: false
"The population in general is very well educated about AIDS," says Anthony Kasozi, "thanks to the commitment of the Ugandan Government who have done well in raising awareness." :: false
The need here is to convince people that they must change their behaviour. :: false
We are seeking to find out what local people want, because they must own the work themselves. :: false
"In this way, with a little money but much commitment, a great deal can be done." :: false
You can be perfectly well with HIV and at other times chronic debility makes it hard to do even the basic things. :: false
In the early days the stigma of being HIV positive had driven away about 60% of my circle of friends. :: false
Despite the publicity giving the facts surrounding the transmission of the disease, ignorance was such that they became afraid of normal social contact. :: false
It soon became clear that I could no longer rely on friends for help with everyday chores like shopping and housework when I needed it. :: false
While deciding to stay as independent as possible, I contacted ACET who I knew provided practical care at home. :: false
I had previously spent about two years asking local social services and friends for help and not having it happen, so my flat had become pretty run down. :: false
There was also the question of my own exhaustion. :: false
Help provided by ACET volunteers eventually go the flat ship-shape again and life became easier. :: false
Illnesses, including chronic muscle debility, herpes, tremors and eye infections, have come and gone. :: false
Recently I have experienced serious and potentially fatal fevers. :: false
I have far fewer friends and I am partially sighted, which makes me a lot more vulnerable; but whatever happens physically, I have always said that it was what happened mentally that mattered. :: false
Being aware of the stress and pressure that many people and their families experience when AIDS or HIV is first diagnosed, I became involved in counselling. :: false
I have also campaigned for the Government to give AIDS greater recognition, not as a disease affecting specific sectors of the community, but as a social problem for which there must  be adequate welfare provision. :: false
Organisations like ACET need this support to enable people like myself to retain maximum control and continue to live at home as independently as we can. :: false
I have in recent years edited a self-help journal for people with AIDS, written for the national press and researched a variety of medical material for television. :: false
Without the help of ACET and other direct service organisations and charities, I would not have been able to continue and maintain my independence. :: false
Just before leaving to attend the Conference itself, Patrick fitted in a live broadcast on Radio 4's "Today Programme". :: false
During the week the BBC took the opportunity to broadcast part of another pre-recorded interview on Radio 4's "File on 4", while Capital Radio broadcast a four-part feature on AIDS, again including a "canned" interview with Patrick. :: false
Patrick's attendance at the Florence Conference was sponsored by the pharmaceutical firm, NAPP. :: false
Congratulations to Brian Harris, former Manager of the Education Department, on his new appointment as Manager of a housing project for the Shaftesbury Society in Kilburn. :: false

Rev J Powrie, 22 years Minister of Chalmers - Ardler Parish Church, Church of Scotland, has recently been appointed as member of ACET's Advisory Council. :: false
The need for volunteers from churches, particularly in London and Scotland in the day-time, is an ever constant one. :: false
Volunteer Manager, Chris Catlin, says, "We have traditionally recruited volunteers from across the denominations including Anglican, Methodist, Baptist, Catholic and House Churches." :: false
"After spending some time, often years, with us, people move on to other things and we need to fill the gaps." :: false
In London, volunteer training programmes will now take place every September and February and will require an individual's time for one evening a week over a six-week programme. :: false
Maurice Adams, ACET General Manager, and Overseas Development Worker, Kate Bristow, have recently returned from Romania. :: false
Kate has been overseeing an AIDS education course in Constanta together with a local representative, Ana Ureche. :: false
A similar course held at the beginning of the year in Brasov, attended by sixty people including teachers, nurses and doctors, was particularly encouraging as much of the material was, in turn, passed on to other colleagues for their use. :: false
The success of the initial pilot programme has been recognised by the Ministry of Health and the Institute of Health Education and led to Maurice, Kate and Ana meeting with Government officials and representatives from UNICEF to establish a long-term training programme in five Romanian regions, starting in November of this year. :: false
The attitude of many Romanian health professionals was summed up recently in the words of one doctor in Constanta who said "Health Education is the only "vaccine" we have to fight against HIV." :: false
Kate Bristow commented, "It is a real privilege for ACET to be asked to work with such people as they look for ways to develop an effective strategy." :: false
Professor Jonathan Mann, former director of the WHO Global AIDS Programme, has given his backing to ACET by joining Dr Everett Koop the former US Surgeon General, as an International Adviser. :: false
"I am delighted to support ACET's developing international AIDS programme." :: false
Ten years after the discovery of AIDS we are entering into a new era in the global pandemic, with growing concern about our ability to confront it successfully. :: false
New approaches are needed, with close partnerships between local communities, non-government agencies, governments and international organisations. :: false
"I believe ACET has an important part to play in this process." :: false
He added, "We are just at the beginning of the worldwide epidemic and the situation is still very unstable." :: false
The major impact is yet to come. :: false
Over the next decade a global approach is going to be essential. :: false
The money was part of the proceeds from the sale of unclaimed property sold under the Police Property Act. :: false
MAJOR CHANGES in the pattern of HIV disease occurring in the capital which are not obvious from published statistics. :: false
The biggest changes are in the length of time people ill with the disease are now surviving and in the nature of the illnesses themselves. :: false
Between 1984 and 1986 those with AIDS died on average some ten months after diagnosis. :: false
Between 1987 and 1989, however, the survival period has already doubled to twenty moths. :: false
Patients diagnosed more recently are probably surviving an average of longer than two years. :: false
The "cause of death" figures are also changing beyond all recognition. :: false
While pneumonia is still a common occurrence, current preventative measures and improved treatment have reduced the numbers dying as a result to only 3% by 1989. :: false
With the pneumonias, the interval between early chest infection and death could be as little as 12 hours in someone outwardly fit and well. :: false
The commonest cause of death is now advanced Kaposi's Sarcoma (a kind of cancer). :: false
Slowly growing internal lesions can produce great difficulties in the lung and the gut, causing shortness of breath and other problems. :: false
Over a year or two, therefore, we have shifted from a population of recently diagnosed AIDS patients, often reasonably well but with lives dominated by a threat of pneumonia, to a population surviving longer and developing a range of further complex problems of a chronic debilitating nature. :: false
As London's largest independent provider of community care for people ill with AIDS, staff at ACET have seen these changes unfold in the home. :: false
The picture then has changed and we now need to plan for increasing numbers of those with chronic illnesses needing specialist community care - not just volunteers, although volunteers continue to have a vitally important role to play. :: false
Until the numbers of deaths each month has risen to equal or exceed the number of new diagnoses, the numbers needing care will continue to rise fast, even if the number of new cases reported in official figures is relatively constant or falling. :: false
These factors help explain some of the reasons why the total number of ACET clients covered at any one time by our on call service in London has more than doubled from 70 in April 1990 to over 150 by March 1991. :: false
Forward planning and good communication are the two foundation stones that must be in place to guarantee that people ill with HIV have the best choices and continue to enjoy the very best quality of life, wherever they choose to be.  :: false
Three ACET staff members, Peter Fabian, Director of Resource Development, Sue Lore, a specialist HIV community nurse and Peter Glover, Press and Information Officer, featured on Radio Thamesmead, North Kent, in an hour-long chat show in April, speaking on AIDS and AIDS care in the community. :: false
ACET's Scottish Office was also featured on "Songs of Praise" on BBC1. :: false
Care-link units, designed to provide remote signalling of distress via the telephone systems, are currently on loan with seven clients in London. :: false
Help can be summoned from ACET or other services merely by pressing a button on a pendant worn around the neck. :: false
This can make all the difference to someone who feels unsafe alone at home. :: false
Referrals to ACET for Home Care in the London area have increased in the last six months by 50%. :: false
At the present rate of referral, numbers are more than set to double during the year. :: false
Referrals of African men and women infected heterosexually abroad are also increasing. :: false

The rapid growth of ACET since its inception in 1988 has made the creation of this new post a priority. :: false
"I was impressed by the care given to our clients in London and elsewhere," explained Peter, "and the lengths to which ACET staff go to try and meet the needs of clients." :: false
I feel that working in partnership with the client, and with other agencies, is the most effective way of ensuring the needs of our clients are met. :: false
Peter studied astronomy at University College, London, and worked in accountancy for a short spell before deciding upon a career in nursing. :: false
He spent three years at Charing Cross Hospital School of Nursing before qualifying as a Registered General Nurse in 1983. :: false

The plight of children infected with HIV was recently highlighted by Princess Diana when she presented a report by the National Children's Bureau to a London conference on the impact of AIDS on family life. :: false
ACET already has experience in caring for children ill with the disease, particularly through its Scottish office. :: false
In the experience of ACET staff and volunteers, practical care in the home not only benefits the HIV infected individual but the whole family, which can often mean three generations. :: false
At least 60% of the individuals being cared for by ACET in Tayside also have children themselves. :: false
Some of these children are infected, but those who are not are still affected by HIV. :: false
ACET believes that specialist and volunteer home care is a vital factor in helping to keep families together and lessening the trauma involved when family members are diagnosed HIV positive. :: false
Hampshire County Council has provided £20,000 to furnish the building. :: false

IN JANUARY 1988 a small group of 50 would-be volunteers met in the Ealing YMCA to learn about AIDS. :: false
This was the beginning of ACET. :: false
Many of the first group completed a training course to provide practical help in the home for a small number of people ill with HIV/AIDS. :: false
The first referrals came from Ealing, Acton and surrounding areas. :: false
This was coordinated from the living room of a local doctor. :: false
The remit of this fledgling group was to provide the highest standards of unconditional care to men, women and children ill at home with HIV/AIDS. :: false
Within a short space of time referrals were regularly coming in. :: false
In June 1988 ACET was officially launched as a registered charity. :: false
Over the next six months this small group of professionals and volunteers provided practical care for 15 people living in or around the Borough of Ealing. :: false
To date ACET has provided professional nursing care or practical help to over 400 individuals across London. :: false
In Ealing alone we have received over 30 referrals for Home Care. :: false
In Ealing, social workers, H.E.A.R.S (Hounslow & Ealing AIDS Response Service) and the Ealing Home Support team have made referrals to ACET to provide for needs where a single agency cannot give all of the support required. :: false
Likewise ACET has also involved other agencies on behalf of the client. :: false
Both the Borough and Health Authority have supported the work of ACET in Ealing by being among the first to provide financial support. :: false
ACET is currently working with the Health Authority to develop a service level agreement for 1991/92. :: false
I arrive at the office for what looks like a quiet day catching up on necessary office work and telephoning some of our low-dependency clients to see how they are. :: false
There's a message on the answerphone from Tony's brother. :: false
Tony has been unwell over the weekend. :: false
One of the nurses rings back, discusses the situation and says she will ring the hospital and/or his GP to see what can be done. :: false
I am asked if I can be on standby if transport is needed? :: false
This includes nurses and volunteers. :: false
We are now waiting for the specialist to phone back. :: false
Westminster Hospital, say that Andrew, on of their patients, needs to be admitted but they are unable to find transport as no ambulance is available. :: false
No other organisation can help. :: false
We agree to help and perhaps I can combine the two visits. :: false
Tony has been given an appointment at the local hospital. :: false
I will be able to take him and continue into London to pick up Andrew. :: false
At least I'll be able to have lunch first and not be munching my sandwich in a traffic jam. :: false
Tony, and his Mum, are still getting ready to arrive. :: false
He is not at all well, very breathless, and by the time we are in the care he is gasping for air. :: false
Having left Tony and his Mum at his appointment, I set off in the direction of the A4. :: false
Although he is suffering from a type of septicaemia, he is clearly having a good spell. :: false
We make the most of this and scoot off to the hospital. :: false
If I can't take him he will have a two-hour wait for an ambulance. :: false
Tony is ushered into a side ward with three doctors and I stay outside with Mum. :: false
The only problem is, she is Ugandan and speaks very little English, has no idea how to get home and has no money for transport. :: false
I try to explain that, unlike her home country, she will not be staying in with him. :: false
Nobody seems to have explained this to her, but finally she understands. :: false
Her daughters have however been contacted so I agree to keep her company until they arrive. :: false
As the doctors are still with Tony, I explain the position to the daughters and hand Mum over to them. :: false
Cedria is a full-time volunteer and one of national network of volunteers. :: false
Both full- and part-time work is carefully organised according to the availability and skills of each volunteer. :: false
All volunteers are carefully selected and trained.What is ACET? :: false
AIDS Care Education and Training is a company limited by guarantee. :: false
On the bleak and barren Alston Moor, near the Durham border, is this village built in the early nineteenth century for the miners employed by the London Lead Company. :: false
The Quaker mine-owners could hardly avoid the site's exposure to the ravages of moorland weather, but they provided for the welfare of their employees, with sick pay and adult education schemes that became models for other employers. :: false
What is now the "over-sixties" rest room' used to be the Mining Men's Reading Room. :: false
Relics of the  lead-mining and smelting industry are scattered on the moors in the vicinity. :: false
The industry declined before the century was out through competition from cheaper foreign lead. :: false
The Old Mill, in Congleton Road, is a sixteenth-century corn mill preserved in working order by the National Trust. :: false
It is a stone building with a big low-pitched and stone-flagged roof, and its power is provided by two overshot waterwheels. :: false
The mill remained in commercial use until the Second World War. :: false
It is open to the public during the afternoons in summer months, every day except Monday, and on Wednesday and Sunday afternoons in spring and autumn. :: false
At the village's eastern outskirts, surrounded now by a modern housing estate, a conical brick kiln is preserved. :: false
It stands like a phallic exhortation to the newly-weds living around it, but was a hive of industry once, dating possibly from the seventeenth century. :: false
Brick-making was an early industrial entrant into the Chiltern Hills, where there is no natural building stone except flint, and it was in the fifteenth century that brick works first appeared at Nettlebed, to establish a local business that lasted for five hundred years. :: false
Of the five bridges crossing the Tyne at Newcastle, none is more famous than the High Level Bridge built 1845-9 by Robert Stephenson ( q.v. :: false
It was a daring piece of engineering - a railway bridge constructed of iron arches between stone piers, with a road bridge and footpaths suspended below the arches. :: false
It takes the railway line into the city's Central Station, itself a notable piece of railway building, designed by John Dobson, the architect who was responsible for so much of Newcastle's new central stylishness in the nineteenth century. :: false
The station was built in 1850. :: false
Between the High Level Bridge ( q.v. ) and the New Tyne Bridge of 1928 is the Swing Bridge, which was built in 1876 to replace the only river crossing that was here before Stephenson's railway bridge. :: false
There had been a bridge    since Roman times, and some remains of a medieval one can still be seen. :: false
The value of Newcastle's shipping industry in the nineteenth century made it necessary for large ships to pass up the river, and the low stone bridge of 1771 was demolished to make way for the Swing Bridge built by Armstrongs, and at that time the largest of its kind in the world. :: false
It is 281 feet long and weighs nearly I, 500 tons. :: false
It was originally operated by steam-powered hydraulic pumps, but is now driven electrically.  :: false
The inventor of the "atmospheric engine", which was one of the greatest technological advances in modern history, was born at Dartmouth ( q.v. ) in 1663. :: false
Thomas Newcomen became a blacksmith and an ironmonger, and it was in 1705 that, in partnership with Thomas Savery and John Colley, he patented the first engine which made use of steam as a motive power. :: false
The revolutionary principle was the introduction of a piston into the cylinder, which was pushed up by steam pressure to raise one end of a rocking beam. :: false
The piston then fell again under atmospheric pressure to raise the other end of the beam. :: false
The immediate application of this engine was in pumping water out of mine workings, which had often become so badly flooded that it was impossible for them to be worked, and pumps driven by waterwheels were unequal to the huge drainage problems. :: false
But in the long term he opened the way to the great revolution in industry that came with the advances on his original idea, made by such as James Watt and Richard Trevithick ( qq.v. :: false
Newcomen died in 1729, when his engines were coming into increasing use all over Europe as well as in Britain, and soon in America too, but he had gained little financial advantage from his invention. :: false
His house in Dartmouth was demolished when a new road was made in 1864, and the fact that the road is named Newcomen Road is no compensation for the loss of a house that would have been holy ground for today's industrial enthusiasts. :: false
There is a monument to Newcomen, however, in the park of Bayard's Cove, Dartmouth. :: false
Late in the eighteenth century a Glasgow industrialist, David Dale, built a cotton mill here in collaboration with Arkwright ( q.v. ), and around it built a model village for his workers. :: false
In 1797, Robert Owen ( q.v. ) met Dale's daughter, Anne Caroline Dale, whom he later married, and subsequently took over the New Lanark Mills, which employed a thousand people. :: false
Here Owen set about the great social reforms which made New Lanark for a time one of the most celebrated places in Britain; he improved both the working and the living conditions of those on whose labour he depended, and proposed a system of universal co-operation in industry in place of the misery of exploitation. :: false
The old mills, houses, school and other buildings dating from Robert Owen's time are preserved, and there is an exhibition centre in a former counting house. :: false
Newnham Mill, on the River Rea near the busy road junction, is an eighteenth-century water-powered corn mill which has been restored to full working order, its machinery driven by an undershot wheel of fifteen-foot diameter. :: false
The mill can be seen working at weekends and bank holidays in the summer months. :: false
Crossing the River Usk near the docks is one of the only four transporter bridges built in Britain. :: false
Their purpose was to span rivers without hindering navigation, by supporting a beam high above the water level on two towers, and carrying goods across in vehicles suspended from the beam on cables. :: false
The Newport bridge was built in 1906, the second of the British transporter bridges, and it is still used. :: false
North-east of the town centre is a large factory built in 1827 for the lace manufacturers Freeman and Nunn. :: false
The firm came here from the Midlands, where new lace-making machinery was threatened by the Luddite riots. :: false
The factory is a three-storey building of yellow brick. :: false
It was used as a lace factory until 1877, and is now government property. :: false
Nearby is the hospital, originally built as a House of Industry, or workhouse, around 1770. :: false
Called Tickford Bridge, it is said to be the oldest iron bridge in Britain still in constant use. :: false
Further speculation ascribes its  basic design to Thomas Paine, author of The Rights of Man. :: false
It was actually Henry Provis who built this single-span bridge, but the construction method of openwork voussoirs bound together with iron straps was patented by Rowland Burdon, a Sunderland M.P. :: false
The Hunday National Tractor and Farm Museum at this location near Corbridge has Europe's finest collection of vintage tractors, as well as stationary steam engines and other agricultural machinery. :: false
An early eighteenth-century water mill has also been re-erected at the site, with a twenty-foot wheel driving two pairs of millstones. :: false
The birthplace of Robert Owen ( q.v. ) was formerly an important weaving town, and in Commercial Street there is a Textile Museum, once a workshop. :: false
Exhibits include hand looms and later machinery. :: false
There is also a museum dedicated to the life and work of Robert Owen, on the site of his birthplace, above the Midland Bank. :: false
Both museums are open on weekdays only in the summer months. :: false
In Bridge Street is a Museum of Leathercraft, at the heart of the region associated with the boot and shoe industry. :: false
The museum exhibits the uses of leather throughout history, with a fine collection of leather craftsman-made objects (not just footwear). :: false
The museum is open on weekdays throughout the year. :: false
The "wich" name ending is a clue to an ancient industry for which Cheshire is famous - salt mining. :: false
Northwich, Middlewich and Nantwich, as well as Droitwich in Hereford and Worcester, were all known to the Romans for their salt deposits, and several ancient routes across Britain are known as "salt ways" because salt was carried on them in trains of packhorses to the far corners of the kingdom. :: false
The salt beds lie beneath the rock known to geologists as Keuper Sandstone, and mining was the early method of extracting it. :: false
One firm still mines salt at Winsford. :: false
It was found later that if  bore holes were sunk into the deposits and water circulated in them, the solution could be pumped up and the salt extracted by evaporation, and this is what is done at Marston :: false
The effects of mining can be seen around Northwich, where the formation of large pools or "flashes" is due to mining subsidence. :: false
In London Road there is a Salt Museum with exhibits on the history and techniques of this essential industry, in a building that was once the local workhouse. :: false
The old part of Norwich is tucked into a bend in the River Wensum, and as the city expanded, many bridges were built to carry its roads over the river. :: false
Around Stoney Street (south-east of city centre near St Mary's Church) is a commercial complex built in the nineteenth century, occupying a considerable part of the medieval town's former area, and now known as the Lace Market. :: false
It consists mostly of plain four-storey brick warehouses with a few more ornate buildings among them. :: false
Nottingham's lace industry arose from attempts to bring to hand-lace-making the kind of mechanization that Midlands manufacturers had brought to hosiery knitting. :: false
In the second half of the eighteenth century some progress was made, but it was the invention of the bobbin net machine by John Heathcoat ( see  Tiverton) in 1808 that provided the foundation for mechanical lace-making. :: false
By 1885 Nottingham had over 2,000 machines at work in steam-powered factories, and 10 per cent of the whole county's population was employed in the lace industry. :: false
The enormous increase in the demand for lace was largely due to the fashion for lace curtains which came at the same time as a huge house-building programme, and buyers came from home and abroad to negotiate their deals in the Lace Market. :: false
When the Industrial Revolution brought huge woollen mills powered by steam to the towns of Yorkshire's West Riding, there were many unfortunate social consequences. :: false
Thousands of insanitary back-to-back houses  were built to get as many as inhumanly possible into every acre of land to accommodate the legions of workers. :: false
During the nineteenth century, Leeds increased its population from 53,000 to nearly half a million, and Bradford's growth rate was even greater. :: false
One of the worst effects of massive manufacturing industry was the employment of young children in the factories for up to fifteen hours a day, when the huge slump in hand-loom weaving forced parents to live off their children. :: false
Children employed by such as William Douglas at his cotton mill in Salford were often taken from the workhouse at six or seven years old and worked for long hours, and were sometimes so ill-treated that they committed suicide. :: false
Douglas's mill was known as the "Cripple Factory" because children became deformed by the work they were forced to do. :: false
Richard Oastler was a leading campaigner against those who employed children. :: false
He was born in Leeds in 1789 and trained as an architect, but by 1830 had taken over the fight against child abuses from Robert Owen ( q.v. ), and conducted a vigorous campaign for a ten-hour day, which only succeeded in 1847 with the passing of the Ten Hour Bill limiting the working hours of all those aged up to eighteen. :: false
He died in 1861. :: false
Oldham was the scene of a great building boom in the second half of the nineteenth century, and many ordinary working folk bought shares in the great cotton industry that gave rise to it. :: false
The Oldham Stock Exchange developed out of a new class of capitalists not portrayed in the industrial scenarios of Marx and Engels. :: false
Though many mills have been either demolished or converted to other uses, the great buildings still dominate the town. :: false
They are mostly of brick, unlike the woollen mills of Yorkshire, which are nearly always of stone. :: false
In the churchyard of All Saints, a monument stands to the men killed during the construction of the nearby Bramhope railway tunnel in 1845-9. :: false
It consists of a scale model of the tunnel's castellated northern portal. :: false
The tunnel was built by the Leeds and Thirsk Railway, and is a little over two  miles in length. :: false
The towers of ventilating shafts can be seen above its course. :: false
A five-storey brick mill at the western outskirts of the little town was built in 1790 as a serge mill, powered by a waterwheel driven by the River Otter (the waterwheel is no longer in use). :: false
The venture was unsuccessful, and thirty-three years later the mill became a silk factory. :: false
It is now occupied by an engineering company, and is not open to the public, but its most interesting feature is outside and can be seen from beside the millstream. :: false
It is a rare circular weir through which water by-passing the wheel tumbles into a tunnel beneath the mill on its return to the river. :: false
The windmill in full working order on the heath is a post mill of 1665, the earliest mill still operable, though its machinery dates mainly from the nineteenth century. :: false
The weatherboarded top was originally supported by the timber trestle, which has since been enclosed within a brick roundhouse. :: false
The mill can be visited at weekends. :: false
West of the village in Lathkilldale are remains of the lead-mining industry once so important in the Peak District. :: false
The remains of engine houses and mining shafts are found over a wide area in this region, as well as "rakes" long fissures stretching for miles across the landscape, where miners extracted ore from narrow veins in the carboniferous limestone. :: false
Here, as well as an engine house and other works, is Mandale Sough, a drainage channel one mile long which took twenty-three years to dig. :: false
By the time it was finished, the workings had gone lower than the levels it was meant to drain. :: false
Owen was the son of an ironmonger and one of seven children. :: false
He left home at the age of ten and went to London, then to Stamford, where he became apprentice to a draper and educated himself in his spare time. :: false
After a brief return to London, he went to Manchester, and was soon in business building spinning machines for the  cotton mills, from which he graduated to becoming a mill owner himself at New Lanark ( q.v. ) with a thousand employees. :: false
Here he put into practice the ideas of social justice expounded in his book A New View of Society , and became a nationally known figure. :: false
His chief concerns were with the conditions of labour and education of the working classes, and he was the instigator of the Factory Act of 18 19, which prohibited the employment in textile mills of children under ten, and reduced working hours for those under eighteen. :: false
Owen was buried in the churchyard at Newtown, and there is a statue of him in the town's memorial park. :: false
This was an important mining town on the western fringes of Dartmoor in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. :: false
The Wheal Friendship Mine produced lead, iron, copper and arsenic from right under the main street, and the production of arsenic here went on until 1925. :: false
Some remains of the plant are on the eastern outskirts of the village, while a mile to the north, off the A386, the National Trust preserves the former engine house of Wheal Betsy Mine, which produced lead, silver and zinc into the late 1870s, being known then as the Prince Arthur Consols mine. :: false
The Menai suspension bridge linking Anglesey with Holyhead was built by Thomas Telford ( q.v. ) from 18 19&ndash;26 as the final part of his great work of re-aligning the road from London to Holyhead. :: false
He was forced to abandon his original plan for an arched bridge of cast iron by the need for ships to be  able to pass through the strait, and he opted instead for a suspension bridge 100 feet above water level and with a span of 579 feet. :: false
It far exceeded anything of the kind done before anywhere in the world, and combined grace of design with several novel features in the construction. :: false
But it was a step into the unknown that caused Telford considerable anxiety despite his reputation for unruffled calmness in the face of difficulties. :: false
The chains for the bridge were cast at Upton Magna in Shropshire and thoroughly tested on a machine Telford devised for the purpose. :: false
There were 16 suspended chains, each weighing nearly 24 tons. :: false
Several modifications have been made to this bridge in the century and a half since its completion, but it remains basically the same bridge that Telford designed, and was one of the great civil-engineering achievements of the period.  :: false
The world's largest transporter bridge, built in 191 I, remains here spanning the Tees, and is a remarkable piece of engineering. :: false
It was built by the Cleveland Bridge and Engineering Co. to replace the ferry service across the river to Port Clarence and carries suspended cars below the gantry 160 feet above the river, to allow the passage of large vessels. :: false
The cars are  propelled electrically. :: false
The length of the bridge is 850 feet. :: false
The terminus at each end was connected to the line by a steep incline surmounted with the help of a stationary steam winding engine, and at Middleton Top the engine house survives complete with its engine, a Butterley double-beam engine of 1829 which has been restored to working order. :: false
It hauled wagons up a I-in-8 slope. :: false
The engine may be seen on Sundays and on some Saturdays when it is operated. :: false
East of Manningtree on the Stour estuary, this village possesses a fine range of maltings built in the nineteenth century. :: false
The Old Maltings, disused since 1967, are two-storey buildings of the traditional type, in which barley was converted into malt for the brewing of ale. :: false
The malting business became concentrated in the south-eastern and eastern counties of England because that is where most of the country's barley was grown, and "maltings", familiar by their long rows of windows and kilns with cowled tops, are most common in Essex, Suffolk and the eastern fringe of Hertfordshire. :: false
In the old method, barley grain was swollen by soaking in water for two or three days, then spread out on floors and exposed to air at a constant temperature to induce germination, which usually took two to three weeks. :: false
Then the grain was roasted in the kilns to produce malt for delivery to the breweries. :: false
The "new" maltings at Mistley are multi-storey buildings of the late nineteenth century using more up-to-date methods, and are still working. :: false
The preserved blast furnace beside the Ashby Canal was built by Lord Moira, inheritor of the property of the powerful Hastings family, who had been mining coal here since the sixteenth century. :: false
The earl was one of the promoters of the canal, which was opened to traffic in 1794, and he continued to use it after his rivals had switched to the railway. :: false
The canal never actually reached Ashby-de-la-Zouch, which gave it its name, but it was a very successful commercial waterway. :: false
The large brick blast furnace  was built with its tiers of arches at the beginning of the nineteenth century, and was producing iron for about a century and a half. :: false
The railway station in North Bridge Street is a notable example of the neo-classical style in railway architecture. :: false
It looks more like a museum, and indeed that is exactly what it now is. :: false
Built by John Dobson in 1848, it has tall Ionic columns with triangular pediment like a Greek temple. :: false
This village on the River Tamar 4 miles south-west of Tavistock was once a very busy port serving the largest copper mine in Europe, known as Great Consols. :: false
The miners worked for 14 shillings a week, making vast fortunes for the shareholders, chief of whom were the Russell family, who had acquired the land after the dissolution of the Benedictine abbey at Tavistock. :: false
A canal had been dug by French prisoners of war from what is now Dartmoor Prison, and it passed through a 2-mile-long tunnel to the hillside above the quay. :: false
Arsenic refineries and lime kilns had been operated here, too. :: false
Now Morwellham Quay has been restored and developed as an open-air industrial museum, where visitors can see the docks, inclined planes and waterwheels, and go underground into one of the disused copper mines. :: false
The museum is open throughout the year. :: false
West of the village centre are vast quarries from which granite has been taken since Roman times. :: false
The nineteenth-century village church is built of it.  :: false
A cairn to the south of this coal-mining and iron-working town marks the site of John Loudon McAdam's original works. :: false
McAdam revolutionized road-making by his realization that a dry firm road surface would support traffic without the necessity of such solid foundations as Telford used. :: false
A tightly compacted surface of graded stones kept water at bay and lasted a long time. :: false
McAdam's system, which involved his surveyors checking the size of stones by passing them through a two-inch ring, was soon adopted by the turnpike trusts. :: false
Spraying with tar was a later development in which McAdam himself had no part. :: false
There is a story that a Hertfordshire man, George Allen, who made the metal rings for McAdam, asked him what a stone-breaker was to do if he lost the ring. :: false
"Why, George," McAdam replied, "let him try the pieces in his mouth." :: false
"If they go in they will be small enough." :: false
The Cotswolds were at the forefront of woollen manufacturing in England until the rise of factory industry gave precedence to Yorkshire. :: false
Nailsworth was one of the important centres of the trade, and one of the ancient wool town's pubs is still called the Clothier's Arms. :: false
North of the town centre on the Stroud road, several old stone-built mill buildings survive, of which the largest is Dunkirk Mills, dating partly from the eighteenth century. :: false
The main range is of four storeys. :: false
Three waterwheels drove the machinery here. :: false
The buildings are not open to the public, but Nailsworth and other nearby Cotswold towns and villages, such as Chipping Campden, Painswick and Uley, are rewarding places to visit for an impression of the wealth of local clothiers who built themselves fine houses as well as fine churches for their communities. :: false
This unique industrial museum at the south-western edge of Sheffield was formerly a scythe works, built in the eighteenth century and comprising stone-built mill and ancillary buildings, manager's house and workmen's cottages. :: false
Sheffield was already known for its knives by the fourteenth century - Chaucer refers to the miller in The Canterbury Tales  as carrying a "Sheffield thwitel" (a large knife). :: false
Here at the Abbeydale museum the process of making edge tools can be followed from start to finish. :: false
The mill was powered by two waterwheels still in situ . :: false
The factory made scythes and other agricultural edge tools using crucible steel made on the site, and the place continued in production until 1933. :: false
Even the crucibles or pots in which the steel was made were produced here, and the pot shop can still be seen. :: false
The original complex, with its steel furnace, grinding and boring shops, forges, warehouse and so on, stood in relatively rural surroundings, but is now enveloped by modern housing. :: false
At Trecynon, a suburb on the north-west side of the town, there is an iron bridge built in 1811 to carry products of the Abernant Ironworks on a tramway from the works to the Glamorgan Canal, and thence to the port at Cardiff. :: false
The "granite city" is the most important of Scotland's east coast fishing ports, and the third largest in Britain. :: false
Early morning visitors to the fish market can see the catches - packed in ice at sea and winched ashore to be displayed in boxes - being auctioned from 7.30 a.m. onwards. :: false
The stone Brig o'Balgownie crossing the River Don north of the town was built with its graceful Gothic arch in the fourteenth century by Robert the Bruce. :: false
It is referred to by Byron in Don Juan .   :: false
The Vale of Rheidol Railway is a narrow-gauge system (1 foot 11&frac12; inches) running nearly 12 miles from the town to Devil's Bridge. :: false
The line was built in 1902, mainly to convey lead from mines in the valley. :: false
It was threatened with closure after the demise of the lead-workings, but was saved and is now operated as a tourist service in summer months by British Rail - the only steam line left in the nationalized network. :: false
The locomotives date from the 1920s. :: false
At this village off the A49 just south of Church Stretton is the Acton Scott Working Farm Museum, where nineteenth-century arable farming techniques are demonstrated using Shire horses and steam-powered machinery. :: false
"Obsolete" breeds of animals are also preserved here. :: false
In the Afon Argoed Country Park, five miles north-east of Port Talbot on the A4107, is a Miners' Museum, set up by the South Wales Miners Museum Committee, and a fine exhibition of the conditions and equipment of coal mining in the area. :: false
The park itself is on land largely reclaimed from derelict colliery sites and slag-heaps. :: false
The museum is open daily during the summer months, and weekend afternoons in winter. :: false
A village church may seem an unlikely scene of industrial development, but the church of St Michael-in-the-Hamlet, in what is now the Liverpool suburb of Toxteth, is of considerable interest. :: false
The architect was Thomas Rickman, who had got together with a local ironmaster, John Cragg, and built St George's Church at Everton in 1814 with much cast iron in the structure. :: false
Everything that could  be made of iron was , from the churchyard fence and gates to the interior columns and arches, the window tracery and door frames, and even the pinnacles on the tower.  :: false
The parish well-head, taking up practically all of the small village green of this remote settlement high on the chalk downs, drew water from one of the deepest wells in the country. :: false
The 372-foot shaft is now sealed, but the well-head with its elaborate winding gear remains, an awesome contraption of wood and iron housed beneath a tiled roof. :: false
There is no law of God or nature that says that a windmill must have four sails, and the independence of millwrights is best seen in Lincolnshire, where there are several surviving mills with more than four sails. :: false
The mill is of the type known as a tower mill, in which only the cap bearing the sails turns in the wind. :: false
The mill at Alford was built in 1837, and is still in working order. :: false
It is built of brick and has six storeys. :: false
The white-painted cap is of ogee shape and also carries the "fantail". :: false
This device was invented in 1746 by a miller named Lee. :: false
It is a wheel of vanes set at right angles to the sails, so that if the wind is not striking the sails, it must strike the fantail and turn the sails into the wind again. :: false
By the time this mill was built, it was possible to use an iron windshaft and gears instead of the all-timber machinery that had for centuries been such a tribute to the skills and ingenuity of millwrights and carpenters. :: false
The speed at which the grinding was done could also be controlled by changing the angle of the wooden slats in the sails. :: false
This high moorland village is an industrial settlement developed early in the nineteenth century to house lead-miners and their families employed by the Blackett family, which had been exploiting the deposits since 1729. :: false
The abandoned workings are above a wood, west of the church of 1825 which accompanies miners' and managers' houses, school and shop, etc., which are still inhabited. :: false
Two complete and rare glass cones survive at the glassworks here. :: false
Only five of these once plentiful buildings remain in Britain. :: false
Two pairs of millstones are powered by a breastshot waterwheel driven by the River Ludd, and can be seen grinding flour on Monday and Thursday afternoons in August and September and some Sundays and bank holidays. :: false
Between the A5025 and B5111 leading south from the town is Parys Mountain, where the most spectacular remains of copper mines in Britain can be seen. :: false
The mines had been worked since the Roman period, but extensive exploitation began in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, when the port of Amlwch was built to handle the copper. :: false
Fifteen hundred men worked at one time in what became the largest copper mine in Europe - a vast open-cast quarry hewn out of the hilltop. :: false
The local boom in copper was over by the year of Waterloo, but mining continued until 1883, and a windmill, whose tower remains, was built to help pump water from the quarry. :: false
Like the works at Coalbrookdale ( q.v. ) the scene here inspired several romantic artists with its spectacle of "sublime terror". :: false
The parish pump in the marketplace is unusual, doubling as a signpost. :: false
The stone pillar carries an inscription to the effect that the pump was put up by the Earl of Upper Ossory in 1785. :: false
The remarkable vertical lift here, which transports boats between the Trent and Mersey Canal and the River Weaver about fifty feet below, is one of the wonders of the inland waterways and a unique piece of Victorian engineering; the only canal lift still in use in Britain. :: false
It was built in 1875 and consists of two wrought-iron tanks or caissons in which boats are raised and lowered by a system of counterbalance, electricity replacing the original steam-powered hydraulic pumps. :: false
Each caisson weighed 240 tons with water in it, and could carry one barge or two narrow boats. :: false
Nowadays pleasure craft use the lift, going up and down within an impressive structure of tubular iron.  :: false
The Scottish Fisheries Museum, at Harbourhead, has extensive exhibits on Scotland's important fishing industry, including typical fishermen's cottages and model fishing vessels. :: false
On a bare peninsula between the coast and the River Garnock, west of Irvine, is the site chosen by Alfred Nobel, the Swedish discoverer of dynamite and founder of the Nobel Prizes, for an 1873 explosives factory. :: false
It is now the works of Imperial Chemical Industries, who produce most of Britain's industrial explosives, for use in quarries, mines and civil engineering works. :: false
He was born at Preston in 1732 and got little education; he was apprenticed to a barber, and set himself up in the barbering trade at Bolton later. :: false
But with the assistance of a Warrington watchmaker, John Kay, he invented improvements to machinery used in the local cotton industry, and in 1769 patented a spinning frame, which made possible the mechanical spinning of the warp, whereas the early Spinning Jenny was only suitable for spinning the weft. :: false
Driven from his home county by the opposition of cotton workers to any machinery that seemed to threaten their livelihoods, Arkwright went to Nottingham and, in partnership with Jedediah Strutt, set up a factory to produce yarn for the knitting industry. :: false
Then in 1771 he moved to Cromford ( q.v. ) in Derbyshire, and there built a large cotton mill powered by water, which led to his spinning machine being called the "Water Frame". :: false
Prosperity and honour followed. :: false
Arkwright bought the manor of Cromford, was subsequently knighted, and became High Sheriff of Derbyshire - not bad for a barber's apprentice. :: false
Sir Richard Arkwright is usually regarded as the father of the factory system. :: false
He brought control and organization to a large labour force, which was ultimately to their benefit as well as his own. :: false
He died in 1792 and was buried in the church which he had built at Cromford.  :: false
The preserved and operational steam-driven Severn Valley Railway between Bewdley and Bridgnorth crosses the river at this point via a cast-iron bridge built by Thomas Brassey in 1862. :: false
It has a flat arch of 200 foot span. :: false
A squat square chimney at Stone Edge, north-west of the village, marks the site of a lead-smelting mill established in the eighteenth century, and entertains a dubious claim to   the earliest industrial chimney in England. :: false
The parish church, at any rate, certainly has the only lead font in Derbyshire, despite the county's long association with lead mining. :: false
The bridge which formerly carried the A5 across the River Severn east of Shrewsbury is a fine seven-arched masonry structure of 1771, and it has been preserved alongside its modern replacement. :: false
The bridge was designed by John Gwynne, a founder-member of the Royal Academy and a friend of Dr Johnson. :: false
The famous Axminster carpet factory, begun in 1755, still stands in Silver Street - a stone building by the parish church, where Thomas Whitty, a cloth weaver, began making hand-knotted wool carpets in imitation of Turkish patterns. :: false
From his beginnings and the slightly earlier ones at Wilton ( q.v. ), knowledge of carpet manufacture spread throughout the country. :: false
The difference between a "Wilton" and an "Axminster" carpet, both of which are now made by about fifty different companies in Britain, is in the type of weave. :: false
An Axminster has its tufts inserted as a separate operation and knotted under the warp. :: false
The firm that made carpets in the old factory in the early nineteenth century went bankrupt, but the industry was revived later. :: false
The modern factory, producing fine quality carpets by machinery nowadays, can be visited on weekdays. :: false
The Caledonian Canal cuts through the Great Glen to form a waterway link between Loch Ness at Fort Augustus and Loch Linnhe near Fort  William, and in effect cuts off the North-West Highlands from the rest of Scotland. :: false
The attractions of a sea-to-sea waterway had taxed the brains of both James Watt ( q.v. ) and John Rennie before Thomas Telford ( q.v. ) was commissioned by the Government in 1802 to construct the canal. :: false
Its benefit was that shipping could avoid the dangerous passage round the north coast of Scotland and - as Britain was at war with France - there was great strategic value in providing a protected route for warships. :: false
The canal took 18 years to complete, twice as long as Telford had forecast, and cost more than double what he had estimated, but it was an outstanding engineering achievement for the time, even though the actual length of genuine canal that had to be dug was only 21 miles, since the navigable channel took advantage of existing lochs along the glen. :: false
There are 29 locks on the canal, the most interesting being here at Banavie, where the so-called Neptune Locks form the largest "staircase" in Britain, consisting of 8 locks. :: false
The canal was never a commercial success, though it was made deeper after Telford's death, but it is still open, and in the First World War it served the strategic purpose for which it had not been needed during the Napoleonic Wars: 70,000 mines were shipped through it, mainly by the U.S. Navy, to protect Allied merchant shipping against German U-boats. :: false
At Penrhyn Castle, in the former stable yard, is an industrial railway museum. :: false
The castle, in the care of the National Trust, was built with huge profits made from slate quarrying by the first Lord Penrhyn, and the principal exhibits in the museum are connected with transportation of the quarry products by rail from Bethesda to Port Penrhyn. :: false
The railway viaduct crossing the estuary of the Mawddach has a footpath alongside, and is partly of timber construction. :: false
The bridge is nearly half a mile long, and incorporates an iron swing bridge at the Barmouth end for the passage of vessels on the navigable channel. :: false
A toll is payable by pedestrians and cyclists (the bridge is not open to traffic). :: false
South of the village is an area known locally as "Hills and Holes" - deserted and overgrown quarry pits where the coarse limestone called "ragstone" was quarried by the Romans and widely used in medieval times. :: false
The cathedrals  of Ely and Peterborough contain much Barnack stone, and local churches and houses were built of it. :: false
The monastery at Peterborough owned the quarries in the Middle Ages, and granted quarrying rights to other abbeys for an appropriate consideration. :: false
Ramsey Abbey, for instance, paid a tribute of four thousand eels a year, during Lent, for the right to take stone from Barnack in the eleventh century. :: false
By the eighteenth century, however, the seams were exhausted and the quarries abandoned. :: false
The area is now a nature reserve. :: false
Barnard Castle was once an important centre of carpets and textiles, and at the end of Thorngate are two tall mill buildings, one of which is a weaving mill dating from 1846. :: false
Along the short tree-lined street there are several eighteenth-century three-storey weavers' cottages with the characteristic long windows to the upper-floor workshops. :: false
East of the town centre is the link between the Don Navigation and the Aire and Calder Navigation, a lock built in 1804. :: false
The Don canal was made to connect Sheffield with the Humber estuary, and various branches and inter-connections were made to the system before the coming of the railways, to make those canals serving the coal-mining and iron and steel industries some of the busiest commercial waterways in the country. :: false
The ruins of the Cistercian Furness Abbey might seem, at first sight, out of place in a book of this kind, but in fact this was a medieval power-house of immense activity. :: false
Second only to Fountains in terms of wealth, Furness derived its huge income from iron-founding, sheep-farming and the export of wool. :: false
Its Chapter House was like a Board Room, where the abbots presided like chairmen of the Board, with the profit motive high on the agenda. :: false
The abbots exercised a feudal lordship over vast territories of northern England - all the Furness district, much of the Lake District and parts of Yorkshire - and they also owned land in the Isle of Man and Ireland. :: false
The monastery rebuilt the castle keep on Piel Island, whence it exported its own wool in ships built in its own dockyard there.  :: false
West of the town is Torbane, the location where James Young discovered the oil shale which was given the geological name Torbanite ( see  Broxburn). :: false
A refinery was built for the industry at Pumpherston, a few miles to the east, and opened in 1884. :: false
The railway station at this historic town on the line between Tunbridge Wells and Hastings is a typically extravagant piece of Victorian railway architecture. :: false
Designed by W. Trees, it has many Gothic features, including lancet windows and a ticket office like a manorial great hall, with beamed roof and elaborate chimneypiece. :: false
The hospital, west of the town centre, was originally the Union Workhouse, or House of Industry, built in 1841 in response to the Poor Law of 1834. :: false
The gabled main block is stone-built. :: false
An interesting group of lime-kilns stands beside the harbour which was built by John Wood Craster at the end of the eighteenth century for the export of lime. :: false
The local fishermen keep their equipment in the arched openings nowadays. :: false
In Plessey Woods along the banks of the River Blyth near Hartford Bridge are the remains of old bell pits. :: false
These were dug as a method of extracting coal at fairly shallow levels, and were usually only about twenty feet deep. :: false
They were called bell pits because their shape in cross-section was like that of a bell due to the method of working the coal. :: false
Circular shafts were dug down to the seams and coal was then dug away from the sides until the pit was in danger of collapsing, which it eventually did after the pit had been abandoned.  :: false
The canal lock on the Chester Canal here is unique in having its chamber walls lined with cast-iron plates. :: false
This was Telford's answer to a problem he was called in to solve. :: false
The lock had been built on quicksand, and gave continual trouble as the ground subsided and water seeped away. :: false
Telford drove piles in behind the lock walls and bolted together the iron plates to make the lock both stable and watertight. :: false
The pressures on space created in Nottingham ( q.v. ) by the rapid expansion of the lace industry in the nineteenth century caused the partial dispersal of the work to other towns within easy reach of the chief centre, and Beeston was one of the main beneficiaries. :: false
The Anglo Scotia lace factory was built around 1870 - a Gothic four-storey building of extravagant design for such a purpose, with castellated turrets and parapet recalling some of the fortress-like factories put up around the time of the Luddite riots. :: false
The Heron Corn Mill on the river north of the village dates from around 1730. :: false
A breastshot waterwheel built of wood and iron, sixteen feet in diameter, drove four pairs of millstones until the mill ceased to operate commercially in 1955. :: false
The mill is open to the public every day except Tuesday during the summer months. :: false
At the junction of the A6 and A517 is North Mill, a cotton mill built in 1804 by the Strutt family, who provided work and good housing for many people here in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. :: false
The mill itself was an advanced "fireproof" building of five storeys, constructed of brick and iron, following the initiative of William Strutt's friend Charles Bage at Shrewsbury ( q.v. :: false
The machinery was originally powered by a large waterwheel. :: false
The mill is still in industrial use and not open to the public. :: false
The tower mill half a mile south-west of the church is the only windmill left  on the island. :: false
It is owned by the National Trust and is a permanent local landmark. :: false
It was built of stone early in the eighteenth century and ceased to be used in 1913. :: false
This is the simplest type of tower mill, predating more sophisticated mills in East Anglia and elsewhere. :: false
Much of the original wooden machinery is intact - it was used to drive two pairs of millstones for grinding corn. :: false
The mill can be visited most days except Fridays, between April and September. :: false
It enabled a rail link to be completed between Newcastle and Edinburgh, part of the North-Eastern Railway promoted by George Hudson, the "Railway King". :: false
The ruins of the medieval Berwick Castle were removed to make way for the station, and some of its stone was used in the construction of the bridge, though parts of it are of brick with stone facings. :: false
The name of the location was used by D.H. Lawrence in Sons and Lovers , and he would have known the engine house and pithead winding gear built in 1873 and now preserved by the county council. :: false
It stands off the A61 north of Nottingham. :: false
Waterloo Bridge, so named because it was built in the year of the battle (1815), is one of the oldest of the iron bridges of considerable size. :: false
In the unlikely setting of Beverley Minster is an unusual piece of pre-Industrial Revolution machinery - a treadwheel crane. :: false
It is in the roof of the crossing tower and the south transept, and is a 17 16 reconstruction of a medieval crane. :: false
Fifteen and a half feet in diameter, it enabled a mason to raise a quarter of a ton of stone at a time.  :: false
Arlington Mill, in this picturesque Cotswold village astride the River Coln, has been both a corn and fulling mill in its time. :: false
The village weavers made cloth in the cottages of Arlington Row, converted from a fourteenth-century monastic sheephouse, and now almshouses owned by the National Trust. :: false
The mill itself is now a private museum devoted to cornmilling and other rural industries, and is open to the public every day from March to October, and at weekends in the winter months. :: false
The bridge crossing the River Torridge is nearly 680 feet long and has 24 masonry arches with spans varying between 12 and 25 feet. :: false
This inconsistency is due to the fact that the bridge was originally built of timber in the last quarter of the thirteenth century, and the arches were dictated by the size of the oak beams used; then in the fifteenth century, when the bridge was rebuilt in stone, the timber structure was used as scaffolding and the masonry erected round it, leaving the original wood enclosed within the stone piers and arches. :: false
This came to light in the present century during widening and repair operations. :: false
The money raised by the medieval trustees responsible for the upkeep of the bridge was surplus to requirements, and enabled the bridge to become a landowner, in which capacity it has helped the poor of the town and built and maintained the old grammar school. :: false
A similar long bridge crosses the Taw at Barnstaple, but this is neither as long nor as irregular as the Bideford bridge, and has been subject to more extensive alteration. :: false
The Five-Rise Locks on the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, opened to traffic in 1774, raise the level of the canal about sixty feet up the eastern side of the Pennines. :: false
These locks are of the "staircase" type, which are different from "flights" of locks in that they are directly inter-connected. :: false
The bottom gate of one lock is the top gate of the lock below it, and water passes directly from one chamber to the next. :: false
In flights, each lock is separated from the next by a space and has its own independent gates. :: false
Telegraph House, dating from early in the nineteenth century, was part of a  chain of signal stations built to relay messages between the Admiralty in London and the Fleet at Portsmouth Dockyard during the Napoleonic Wars ( see also  Cobham). :: false
The tall white building is now a private house, having survived threats to demolish it. :: false
In Banbury Street, east of the city centre, is the Gun Barrel Proof House. :: false
Small arms have been a speciality of Birmingham since the seventeenth century, when gunsmiths were already well established in the town, and in 1813 an Act of Parliament gave Birmingham the right to have its own proofing authority. :: false
No gun can be released for sale until its barrel has been definitively proved and stamped here. :: false
One or two nineteenth-century gunmakers' workshops survive in Birmingham's old Gun Quarter, in Bath Street and Loveday Street, and one of the local pubs is called the Gunmaker's Arms. :: false
The Proof House has an elaborate plaster insignia above its doorway, and though there is no public admittance, reliable reports tell us that barrels are still tested here. :: false
The Gas Street Canal Basin is the terminus of the Birmingham and the Worcester and Birmingham canals, hidden near the centre of the city and the heart of a network with more miles of canal than Venice. :: false
Now a colourful scene of narrow boats with their traditional decoration, this was once a metropolis of water transport created in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries to serve the rapidly expanding local industries. :: false
Victorian warehouses built round the basin have been demolished during redevelopment. :: false
The Lewis Textile Museum in Exchange Street has a fine collection of cotton machinery, including working reproductions of the Spinning-Jenny and Mule of Hargreaves and Crompton respectively. :: false

Richard's fingers played with the card as he recalled their first meeting, 13 years ago, at Adam's party. :: false
"Richard and Susan, I want you to meet our new member of staff, Simon Middleton," Adam said, as a stylishly dressed young man held out his hand in greeting. :: false
Later that evening, Simon had been one of the crowd that had ended up at their house for coffee. :: false
Richard recalled looking across at his wife, her face glowing from the wine she'd drunk, her manner relaxed. :: false
Susan had looked up as she felt his glance and had smiled towards him before moving to the group by the window. :: false
Adam's wife was expounding on the trials of being the mother of a pre-school-age daughter. :: false
As he watched his wife, Richard sensed, rather than saw, her stiffen as the conversation flew around her. :: false
Only he know how parents complaining about their children upset her. :: false
Her longing for a child was something she kept hidden from others; she wouldn't even discuss it with Richard. :: false
"I don't want us to apportion blame," she said. :: false
That had been the start of their friendship with Simon, who had joined in all the social events of the group that summer. :: false
It was a happy time, and only occasionally did Richard see the old sadness return to Susan's eyes. :: false
She'd been very happy that Sunday, 13 years ago, when they'd all gone to Adam's for lunch. :: false
Susan had insisted on doing all the washing up by herself; they'd all had too much wine and might break something, she said. :: false
Simon, however, wouldn't hear of it, and had joined her in the kitchen to help with the dishes.  :: false
Susan was doing the washing up and Simon had insisted on helping her :: false
Later when he had to leave, Richard was sorry to break up the party. :: false
I've got a lot to do tonight. :: false
Simon's lazy voice had interrupted. :: false
"If Susan wants to stay on, then I can run her home later." :: false
"It would be no trouble, Richard." :: false
"You don't need me if you're working, do you darling?" :: false
"Of course not," he had replied, happy for Susan to enjoy herself. :: false
Later, at home, he'd sat engrossed in his work. :: false
Susan had entered quietly, and stood looking over his shoulder, watching him work. :: false
Suddenly, she threw her arms around him and hugged him fiercely in a way she had never done before. :: false
As he held Susan he knew that something was very wrong. :: false
It would have to be his secret now, perhaps forever. :: false
Tests had proved that he could never father a child. :: false
Richard shook his head and closed his eyes against the pain his memories brought. :: false
With a frown he pulled a file towards him and buzzed the outer office. :: false
A few minutes later the elderly owner of "Primrose Cottage" was on the phone. :: false
I've had a letter from Mrs Duncan, a teacher at the local primary school, and she's interested in leasing your cottage. :: false
However, I must tell you that another prospective tenant has appeared on the scene. :: false
He can offer more money but he may not be suitable. :: false
"Do you want time to think about it?" :: false
"I'll do whatever you suggest." :: false
"You know what's best." :: false
As he replaced the receiver he felt faintly sick. :: false
He'd done something dishonest for the first time in his business life, and it sat uneasily on his conscience. :: false
The intercom buzzed. :: false
"Shall I send him in?" :: false
"Send him in now." :: false
He straightened his tie and steeled himself for the meeting. :: false
But he wasn't prepared for the shock of seeing those eyes, his daughter's eyes of startling green flecked with gold, that looked out from Simon's face. :: false
"Good to see you again, Richard," he said. :: false
Richard tried to remember how much he'd liked Simon. :: false
He smiled. :: false
"Sit down, won't you?" :: false
"How's Susan, by the way?" :: false
She's shopping with our daughter today," he said vaguely. :: false
I heard you had a daughter. :: false
"Do you only have the one child?" :: false
For he knew what Susan had done to present him with this daughter, his beautiful Kate, born just 12 years ago, six months after Simon had left their village. :: false
He continued: "I'm sorry, but I'm afraid the cottage you were interested in has gone." :: false
"We'll keep a lookout for something else suitable." :: false
He looked across at Simon and smiled. :: false
"Susan will be sorry to have missed you - it's a pity you have to leave so soon," Richard said hesitantly ushering Simon out of his office, and his life, forever.  :: false

Wander down medieval alleys and cross a maze of canals to enjoy this bewitching Italian city that seems to belong to another time. :: false
The story of Venice began over 1,000 years ago, when early settlers drove a base of wooden piles into the lagoon. :: false
In recent times it was feared that Venice was sinking, but modern engineering has come up with a way of pumping water from the mainland to boost the underground water base on which the city rests. :: false
In summer Venice is crammed with tourists and the heat is often stifling, but autumn is perfect for a short break. :: false
The crowds have disappeared and the weather is still warm. :: false
Leave your map at home and get lost. :: false
The city is a maze of narrow medieval alleyways and bridges, and it's fun to explore among the ornate buildings and candy-striped landing stages. :: false
The city is only about two miles long by one mile wide, so you can walk from end to end in less than two hours. :: false
A good starting point is St Mark's Square, which contains two of the city's top attractions: the Basilica of St Mark and the Doges' Palace. :: false
The Basilica is one of Europe's loveliest churches and tucked away in the sanctuary behind the altar is its most precious altarpiece, encrusted with priceless jewels.  :: false

The top of the Campanile in the square gives a bird's-eye view of Venice. :: false
The bell  tower is the highest building in the city, and from there you'll see a carpet of red-roofed houses rolled out below you. :: false
The Doges' Palace was home to the rulers of Venice for centuries. :: false
It was also a prison, and at the back of the palace is the beautiful Bridge of Sighs connecting it with the dark, damp cells. :: false
Legend has it that the bridge got its name from the plaintive cries of the prisoners as they were escorted across it. :: false
There are more than 400 small bridges crossing the network of narrow canals, but the Grand Canal itself is spanned by only three: the Rialto, the Accademia and the Scalz. :: false
It's the main "motorway" through the city, and there are a dozen or so stalls on the Rialto selling souvenirs - including the painted masks you'll see on sale all over the city. :: false
There are no cars in Venice - you'll often see the locals coming out of their front doors and leaping into the boats tied up outside - and everything must be delivered by water. :: false
The Grand Canal bustles with life: boats deliver vegetables, collect rubbish, and carry people to work. :: false
It loops for two miles through the city, lined with splendid palaces dating from the 14th century. :: false
When your feet are tired, why not hop on a water bus, or vaporetto . :: false
The fare is less than £1. :: false
The most romantic boat ride is by gondola. :: false
They cost around £40 to £50 an hour, but these elegant craft are the epitome of Venice and are worth the splurge just once. :: false
Glide up the Grand Canal or tour the labyrinth of smaller canals for a close-up view of everyday Venetian life. :: false
There are dozens of restaurants offering tourist menus - a three-course meal - for £6 to £10. :: false

St Mark's dominates the city and is surely one of Europe's finest churches :: false

Even apart from the famous sights, Rome's piazzas, fountains and gardens are a delight, and simply wandering is a pleasure in itself. :: false

The Royal Palace, too, is a stunning sight, and in the charming cafés in the Plaza Mayor, at the heart of the old city, you can enjoy tapas, the varied snack dishes so beloved of the inhabitants of Madrid. :: false

Richard ran his fingers over the expensive-looking business card his secretary had just handed to him: "Simon Middleton - Financial Consultant", it read. :: false
"Mr Middleton said he knew the area years ago and now wants a weekend cottage or holiday flat. :: false
I thought of old Mrs Drury's place," said his secretary. :: false
So the debonair Simon had made it big in the financial world. :: false
They'd all known he would eventually. :: false
Transfer the chicken to a plate and set aside. :: false
Add the onion to the juices and cook for 2-3 mins, or until softened, stirring occasionally. :: false
Place the chicken on top of the onions, then arrange the tomatoes, bay leaves and potatoes around the chicken. :: false
Cover the dish with a tight-fitting lid and cook for 1 hour. :: false
Add the beans and cook for a further 30 mins before serving. :: false
To serve, carve the chicken into chunks and serve in bowls with the vegetables. :: false
If you wish, you can make this casserole in a saucepan, simmering it over a low heat on top of the cooker. :: false
Place the mince, breadcrumbs, coriander, egg and seasoning in a large bowl and stir well until they're thoroughly mixed. :: false
With slightly wet hands, carefully form the mixture into 16 even-sized balls and chill in the fridge for 10 mins. :: false

Roquefort is a tangy, greenish-blue marbled cheese from the south of France. :: false
It is made with ewes' milk and is left to ripen for three months in limestone caves. :: false
It has a distinctive flavour that blends well with pork. :: false
If you're unable to find Roquefort, another blue cheese, such as Stilton or Danish Blue, will make an ideal alternative. :: false
Push the smaller cloves of garlic into this cavity. :: false
Pour the stock, wine and sugar over the lamb and season. :: false
There may seem to be a lot of garlic involved here, but don't let that put you off - this country-style stew is based on a Menorcan recipe and the traditional slow cooking gives the dish a sweet, mellow flavour.  :: false
Perfect for bright, winter days, our jumper is made in Sirdar Balmoral Double Knitting - a mixture of wool, alpaca and silk. :: false
It has a large collar and deep pockets - the tassels are an optional feature added once the garment has been made up. :: false
Knitted entirely in broken rib, the pattern needs a little concentration as it is possible to confuse right and wrong side rows; but don't let that put you off. :: false
The parish council is very worried when the controversial barrier opens later this year problems in the village, already vulnerable to flooding, will increase as the water turned away from the shut gates will have nowhere else to go. :: false
However, the National Rivers Authority, which met councillors this week, stressed there would be no danger as the build-up of water near St Osyth and Point Clear would be minimal when the barriers closed. :: false
The £14 million project across the River Colne, near Colchester, was approved despite objections from local residents and councillors. :: false
The NRA claims the scheme is the most cost effective way to protect low-lying land. :: false
Council chairman Phyll Hendy said Point Clear had been isolated from St Osyth several times already this year when the causeway between the two settlements had flooded. :: false
She was worried the water, if unable to flow up the Colne to Colchester, will be forced to find its level in St Osyth.  :: false
"This year we have already been told the reason we have had three surges higher than anticipated was because of the bath-tub effect from closing the Thames barrier," she said. :: false
"I do hope the NRA are right about the Wivenhoe barrier, but I am still concerned." :: false
Fellow councillor Tony Quilter was also unconvinced. :: false
"If you put that barrier up in Wivenhoe to stop the water going into Colchester then it must leave Brightlingsea and St Osyth vulnerable." :: false
Gary Cockett, the NRA's assistant district engineer for North Essex, said every time there was a high tide the Hythe at Colchester flooded because the sea wall was too low. :: false
The barrier would solve that, he said, with a reflected wave of about an inch expected. :: false
St Oysth parish council is also worried about the effectiveness of the flood warning system should sea walls breach in a high tide. :: false
This happened with fatal consequences in 1953 when the Lee Wick wall collapsed sending water shooting over the marshes to Jaywick.  :: false
Mr Cockett said warning of high tides were available 36 hours ahead. :: false
Mr Cockett also allayed fears that areas of St Osyth, originally marshland, had been earmarked for a sea reclamation project. :: false
Sir, - The Chancellor's proposal to add VAT to domestic fuel bills has once again set alarm bells ringing for pensioners and others on low incomes. :: false
It has been claimed that some will have to choose between keeping warm and having enough to eat. :: false
As the 50th anniversary of the ending of World War II approaches, an increasing percentage of pensioners will have seen service in the Forces, or are the widows of ex-servicemen. :: false
For them, there does not have to be the agonising choice of warmth or food, because SSAFA, the Soldiers', Sailors' and Airmen's Families Association, exists to provide help for service and ex-service people, their widows, families and dependents in any crisis. :: false
No matter how brief the service was, or how long ago, SSAFA's trained and experienced volunteers are on hand with prompt, friendly advice and practical help. :: false
They have been doing this in Suffolk for almost 110 years, comforting the sick and lonely, and relieving the worries of the anxious and elderly. :: false
Whatever the problem, financial or otherwise, SSAFA will take it on, in absolute confidence, obtaining specialist assistance when necessary. :: false
No-one is beyond the reach of a local SSAFA member and contact numbers are in the telephone directories. :: false
But providing these services is expensive, in terms of cash and human resources, and we need new members as well as donations. :: false
Through your columns, we appeal to readers for their support in the work we do. :: false
Further information can be obtained by calling 0394 460666. :: false
THE brother of Alison Manwaring yesterday called for a referendum on the death penalty after the killer of his sister and father was jailed for life. :: false
Mark Manwaring said Benjamin Laing was serving a minimum of only 25 years after depriving Alison of 60 years of life and their father Matthew of 20. :: false
He said words were inadequate to describe what he felt about Laing and warned that when he came out of prison "people will be waiting for him and justice will be done properly". :: false
He called for a referendum on the death penalty, accusing politicians of paying lip service to law and order. :: false
"They say things they think will keep us happy until the next tragedy," he told a news conference. :: false
Producing a list of 132 people he said had been murdered in Britain since the beginning of the year, Mr Manwaring blamed the increase in crime on "no bloody deterrent". :: false
He criticised the system which allowed Laing to use the full disclosure of police documents to change his story four times. :: false
Sitting next to Alison's fiance, Gordon Healis, Mr Manwaring said: "The streets have got to be given back to the police and the decent people of this country." :: false
He added: "My dad was 62." :: false
"My sister Alison was 24 and had her whole life ahead of her." :: false
A BOTTLE of sherry and flowers were presented to the first resident of a new nursing home which opened this week. :: false

A POPULAR Ipswich sportsman is back home and planning his summer wedding - thanks to a life-saving heart transplant. :: false
Former footballer Ivan Hender and his fiancee Sue Blackman have just arrived home, six weeks after the vital operation at Papworth Hospital. :: false
Now, the happy couple have decided to marry at the Ipswich Register Office on August 14. :: false
Ivan says he feels great - "I'm contented and happy."  :: false
Ivan, 53, of Cromer Road, underwent a four-hour operation at Papworth near Cambridge in February, after doctors diagnosed a virus affecting his heart, which made him very ill. :: false
Ivan said Sue, whom he met two years ago, had spent almost every hour with him during and since the operation. :: false
"It is incredible what she has done." :: false
"I don't know what I would have done without her," he added. :: false
Ivan also praised the team at Papworth Hospital. :: false
He said he felt no pain, apart from injections which he has never been fond of, and when he came round from the operation the first thing he asked for was the Ipswich football scores and a drink. :: false
Before his illness, Ivan played football, cricket and bowls, and was very well-known among the Ipswich sporting circle. :: false
HOPES of selling an ailing building firm as a going concern are almost non existent, one of the joint administrative receivers said yesterday. :: false
Martin Page of KPMG Peat Marwick said it was likely that R E Gobbitt and Sons of Worlingworth would be wound up after completing existing commitments. :: false
It has been placed in receivership after failing to ride out a long economic recession which has hit the building industry very hard. :: false
It is the second Worlingworth firm to face closure within a few weeks. :: false
Sixty people have already lost their jobs at the Norfolk Smokehouses food processing plant. :: false
Sir, - I believe to the majority of people the addition of VAT to domestic fuel bills will be as welcome as a large hole in a lifeboat would be. :: false
I am however more bemused by the forecast made by Eastern Electricity that, and I quote: "This would add 50p to the average household bill". :: false
If a surcharge of 8 per cent made to a sum of money adds 50p to that sum, then the initial amount is only £6.25 ie £6.25 plus 8pc equals £6.75. :: false
It would be much appreciated if Mr John Devaney, managing director of Eastern Electricity explained in detail what the figure of 50p really relates to. :: false
THE Prime Minister and former defence minister Alan Clark yesterday both signalled their willingness to testify before Lord Justice Scott's inquiry into the arms for Iraq "scandal". :: false
But Lady Thatcher, who is flying back to Britain from the United States, is apparently unaware yet that she will also be invited to give evidence about the affair which, according to one MP, "went right to the heart of Government" when she was in power. :: false
"She should have no hiding place from the scrutiny of Lord Justice Scott's inquiry," said Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrat defence spokesman. :: false
The judge outlined at a London news conference how he will conduct his inquiry which centres on Matrix Churchill, the Coventry-based machine-tool company which allegedly supplied parts for Iraq's so-called supergun. :: false
Three former executives of the company were acquitted at the Old Bailey in November of illegally trying to export arms-making equipment to Iraq amid accusations that Government ministers encouraged manufacturers to emphasise the peaceful uses of their products when seeking export licences. :: false
Labour accused senior ministers, including the Prime Minister, of being aware that the arms embargo against Iraq was being breached. :: false
Labour also claimed that ministers, hiding behind "public interest immunity certificates", were prepared to let the three men be tried. :: false
The TV star and founder of ChildLine said the article alleged she protected teacher Alex Standish because of help he had given her team in exposing child abuse at Crookham Court boys' school in Thatcham, near Newbury, Berks. :: false
Lord Justice Neill said a substantial award was justified and the High Court jury was entitled to conclude that the publication of the article and its aftermath were a "terrible ordeal" for Miss Rantzen. :: false
"But, as has been pointed out, Miss Rantzen still has an extremely successful career as a TV presenter." :: false
"We have therefore been driven to the conclusion that the court has power to, and should, intervene," he said. :: false
"Judged by any objective standards of reasonable compensation or necessity or proportionality, the award of £250,000 was excessive." :: false
Miss Rantzen was ordered to pay a third of the newspaper's appeal costs - which have yet to be calculated. :: false
This does provide a framework for the development of a competitive agricultural industry for the rest of this century. :: false
"We have laid the pattern for the coming decade." :: false
Mr Gummer, MP for Suffolk Coastal, said: "By cutting prices and reducing the role of intervention, the agreement would bring farming nearer to the market and encourage farmers to pay greater attention to consumers" demands." :: false
"It will reduce the resource costs of consumers of agricultural support in the Community." :: false
"Overall the costs imposed by the CAP on the consumer and taxpayer will be lower." :: false
Mr Gummer said last year had seen an 11 per cent recovery in farm incomes, there were encouraging signs for the future and farmers could be cautiously optimistic about the year ahead.  :: false
Mr Gummer unveiled a series of measures to cut costs at slaughterhouses. :: false
He said in a Commons written reply that there has been mounting concern over the costs of veterinary supervision, with hourly fees reaching £40. :: false
He announced the results of a survey of 400 vets working in 600 slaughterhouses which found the average hourly rate was £25.70. :: false
This will act as a yardstick by which industry and local authorities could check they were getting value for money, he said. :: false
A spokeswoman for his department said it would effectively act as a cap on costs. :: false
Mr Gummer also announced strict upper price limits for slaughterhouse hygiene inspectors of £40 for up to four livestock units, and £6.30 per livestock unit thereafter. :: false
A livestock unit means one horse or cow, three pigs or deer, and seven sheep or goats, the spokeswoman said. :: false
A third measure will allow small slaughterhouses to use larger slaughterhouses to provide their veterinary supervision. :: false
AT the stroke of midnight more than 500 further education, tertiary and sixth form colleges left local authority control and became state-funded corporations.In line with the 1992 Further and Higher Education Act, colleges will now be responsible for managing their own budgets and the Government will hold the purse strings, funding them directly through a national FE Funding Council.Once considered the Cinderella of education, further education is now being promoted as the fairy godmother with the ability to improve post-16 education and training, stem the drop-out and failure rates and make Britain economically competitive once more.  :: false
The Government is looking to increase student numbers by 25 per cent over the next three years. :: false
But with many colleges already concerned at lack of accommodation and teaching space, insufficient resources and the prospect of funding by results, will it achieve its aims? :: false
Will independence bring more opportunities for adults and mature students, a wider range of vocational courses and a higher staying-on rate or will it mean more competition, cuts in expensive courses and no overall structure to educational provision from 11-19? :: false
At a celebration dinner last night to mark the achievements of the century-long partnership between Essex County Council and Essex colleges, LEA chairman Ian Abbey toasted the future.He would have liked to see the LEA retain a greater input in further education, he said, but he wished the colleges to go forward in a spirit of goodwill. :: false

THREE police officers facing allegations of possession of drugs will not be prosecuted in a criminal court, it emerged yesterday. :: false
However, sources say it is more than possible they will face an internal disciplinary hearing which could carry a penalty as severe as dismissal from the force. :: false
They were immediately suspended on full pay pending a full inquiry. :: false
A file on the alleged offences was compiled by the Suffolk force's internal discipline department and sent to a special section of the CPS in London which deals with allegations against English police officers. :: false
The CPS has returned the file and said it does not intend to prosecute the officers, who have not been named by police chiefs. :: false
If a disciplinary hearing is to take place, it is likely to occur very soon, a source said. :: false
Police disciplinary hearings are similar to criminal court hearings in that the same rules of evidence and burden of proof, ie beyond reasonable doubt, are used. :: false
A FOUNDING member of the Royal Air Force from Essex will today be meeting the Queen to celebrate the service's 75th anniversary. :: false
Harry Durrant, 92, is one of only 24 veterans from throughout Britain who has been invited to RAF Marham in Norfolk. :: false
He will meet Her Majesty and other members of the Royal Family, including Prince Phillip and the Queen Mother, following a spectacular fly-past. :: false
Mr Durrant, who lives in Kingsway, Dovercourt, said he was "excited, but nervous" about meeting the Queen. :: false
A Leading aircraftsman, he joined the RAF when it was formed in 1918 after transferring from the Royal Flying Corps.  :: false
He saw service in both world wars, having been called back to the RAF reserve when the Second World War broke out and stayed in until 1947. :: false
Mr Durrant will be escorted at today's celebrations by his friend, John Hart. :: false
Mr Hart and his wife, Ruth, managed to get Mr Durrant invited after hearing about the planned celebrations. :: false
"We telephoned the RAF and said we have got a friend who was in the RFC, who transferred to the RAF." :: false
"They then sent him an invitation," Mrs Hart said. :: false
"They are the old and bold from the absolute beginning of the RAF," she said. :: false
"The problem is that many of them have now passed on." :: false

Right, when you've completed that  you have a menu compilation exercise in front of you. :: false
 From the items in the list below prepare to luncheon menus. :: false
One menu should be a four course table d'hote  with two choices for each course  plus vegetables. :: false
You can't  actually repeat any of them  when, in your menu compilation. :: false
There is adequate there  in ar order  to be able to do the exercise. :: false
Now, based on the information that you've just taken down  you need to give thought to the way in which you compile those. :: false
 You can do it within twos  or threes. :: false
There isn't a list   so that  you will need to sort of think it through. :: false
Are we not allowed to use the same things twice? :: false
Well I'm not going to actually tell you because I'll  ruin the solution to this. :: false
you need to think it through. :: false
No you can't use anything twice. :: false
Well, I shall be interested to see what you can get. :: false
No, we're not gonna take forever . :: false
Copy it all down. :: false
I haven't any . :: false
There is a solution! :: false
We can't use  the same things twice? :: false
No, you can't use the same thing twice. :: false
You can't use the same thing twice and coffee doesn't count as a course! :: false
Well then it'll be a course on it's own. :: false
You've got to think about it! :: false
Cheese and biscuits can be a course. :: false
So you've got set menu and you've got table d'hote menu. :: false
Let's see. :: false
What's it called? :: false
Please worry about listing them. :: false
Take a look at those. :: false
That's not the choice is it? :: false
Read the instructions! :: false
Do you have to use all the vegetables? :: false
I think you'll probably be able to. :: false
It's possible to use  all the items. :: false
Did you all manage to complete it? :: false
I want you to bring it in it's completed state to next week's lesson please? :: false
Whoever you're working with  you need, as a pair or a three-some to bring the solution with you next week please? :: false
If there's anyone in your group that suddenly reappears  they need to see Sally  for their  assignments. :: false
That's something else that you need to be aware of. :: false
It would be no good  putting together a menu that required  certain equipment to be used  and staff didn't have the ability to use it. :: false
It would be no good  putting together menu  and arranging to do two thousand covers if you've got  spacing for twenty persons, would it? :: false
 By the same token, if your equipment  is  small pieces of equipment  then you would not have the facility  to do a large volume of meals. :: false
When I'm actually choosing the dishes that I'm going to put on the menu what things do we need to consider? :: false
So what  do we have to think of when we actually compile a menu? :: false
 You need this information to do your exercise that you're going to do for me  shortly. :: false
 So, do not repeat the main ingredients. :: false
Avoid food the same colour. :: false
It actually gives you an example there. :: false
Can you see now? :: false
If you were planning a menu  which would you consider first do you think? :: false
 What would you do? :: false
 I   if you've ever dieted  then you'll be aware that  you actually  reduce the carbohydrates, but you need to retain protein and vitamins. :: false
And  therefore  when you're looking at the nutritional value  you need to be  very aware  of that. :: false
Plan your protein first, vitamins and minerals second, and then your carbohydrates. :: false
Fergus drove quickly on, trees flicking past like green ghosts to the right, the waters of the loch just a dark absence on the left. :: false
Fiona sniffed. :: false
She pulled a handkerchief from her handbag on her lap, dabbed at her nose. :: false
Is that all it was? :: false
I should have realised. :: false
"And we can still go for cocktails at the Frasers" and bridge at the McAlpines and tee off with the Gordons and cruise with the Hamiltons with a united front, a respectable face, can't we, Fergus?" :: false
It's just one of those things that happens at parties; people do get drunk and they do do things they wouldn't normally think of. :: false
Maybe Julie has... or has had, in the past, a crush on me or something. :: false
I don't know. :: false
Well, that's a better try, Ferg. :: false
Fiona looked down, twisting the handkerchief in her fingers. :: false
I knew there was something going on; all those trips away, and getting drunk and not being able to come home, staying at one of your chums" delightful  little pied-â-terres. :: false
Oh, sorry, no, you can't phone back, he's only just got it and it hasn't had a phone put in yet. :: false
Fergus shouted, knuckles white on the steering wheel. :: false
Julie's just a friend. :: false
"I haven't touched her!" :: false
"You didn't have to, she was touching you," Fiona said, voice quiet, looking away from Fergus, out to the darkness of the loch. :: false
A few weak lights shone on the far side, and headlights on the Otter Ferry road, two miles away across the black expanse of waves, swung out briefly, like a lighthouse beam... and then dimmed and disappeared. :: false
The car roared through another small village before the trees hid the view again. :: false
Fiona kept her face away from him, looking out into the night, watching the vertical bright line of light the car threw onto the serried mass of dark conifers. :: false
Even there she could not escape him; she could see his distorted image in the slanted glass of the car's windows, dim in the background, still lit by his instruments. :: false
Of course she could say it was for the children, as people always did... :: false
It was true, up to a point. :: false
How terrible it was to have those easy phrases, trotted out so often in the course of gossip, or heart-to-hearts, or in magazine articles, or even court cases, become so real. :: false
Problems belonged to other people. :: false
God, she had thought she was above that sort of thing, once. :: false
She had been bright and free and determined and she had decided she was going to make her own way in the world, just as well as any of her brothers might. :: false
She'd been a sort of feminist before it became fashionable; never had much time for all that sisterly stuff, but she was positive she was as good as any man and she'd prove it... :: false
London had been exciting, but she had not shone out there, she felt, the way she had here. :: false
She had never felt any affection for the place and had made no friends there she would miss; and anyway, she would find fields to conquer up here, coming home triumphant to wed the lord of the manor. :: false
She had expected to be the centre of things in Gallanach, but the McHoans as a family had so many other things happening to them; she had felt peripheral. :: false
The Urvills' own history, too, made her feel like something unimportant on the family tree, for all that Fergus talked of responsibility and duty and one's debt to the next generation. :: false
She was a leaf, expendable. :: false
Somehow all her dreams had disappeared. :: false
It seemed to her now that all she had ever had had been the dream of having dreams; the  goal of having goals one day, once she had made her mind up what it was she wanted. :: false
So now, she thought, I am married to a man whose touch disgusts me, and who anyway does not seem to want to touch me. :: false
She looked at Fergus's dim reflection, distorted in the glass, then tried to re-focus on her own image. :: false
Can he find me as repellent as I find him? :: false
I can't look that bad, can I? :: false
What's wrong with me? :: false
What did I do? :: false
Why does he have to spend half his time with that drunken, brassy bitch? :: false
God, the best time I've had in the past five years was one night with Lachy Watt, angry at Ferg, and more surprised than anything else. :: false
She shook her head. :: false
That was best left out of it. :: false
Lachy had been back one time afterwards that she knew of, a year later, and he had called, but she'd told him she wouldn't be able to see him, and put the phone down on him. :: false
She looked at the reflection of Fergus again, as he pulled the wheel; the car tunnelled into the forest, the wall of trees on either  side a blur, their greenness more remembered than seen. :: false
I could leave him, she thought. :: false
I could always have left him. :: false
God, I'm pathetic, though, that's so petty. :: false
Why haven't I the sheer drive to just get up and go, take the twins and emigrate to Oz or Canada? :: false
She looked out, into the grey sweep of road ever rushing towards them. :: false
Fergus powered the car down out of the forest, through some more houses and a few lights. :: false
The car lurched. :: false
Fergus looked over, smiled at her. :: false
She didn't know whether to smile back or not, and she wondered what that expression had meant, and what had been going through his head for the last few miles. :: false
The car jiggled on its springs, lurched again and settled. :: false
She clutched at her seat, looking forward. :: false
The engine roared. :: false
She looked back at Ferg, saw tears in his eyes. :: false
"Ferg?" she said. :: false
The car skidded a little, came straight; she glanced forward at the road, saw the corner and the trees. :: false
She clutched at the dashboard with both hands. :: false
"Ferg!" she screamed. :: false
Ken laughed. :: false
Rory smiled, sucking air through his teeth at the same time, clinked one thumbnail against his glass. :: false
He glanced at his brother. :: false
"Don't worry; my secret is safe with us." :: false
He shook his head, then shrugged. :: false
"Okay," Rory sighed, trying to suppress a smile, looking away. :: false
"There might be a job with Aunty in the offing, okay?" :: false
Kenneth laughed. :: false
"It's not definite yet," Rory shrugged. :: false
Shit, Ken; it's just more hack-work. :: false
It's better paid, is all." :: false
"What is it though?" :: false
Rory rolled his eyes. :: false
"It's not definite, like I say, and I don't want to get anybody's hopes up, so keep it quiet; but things might start to happen."  :: false
"But that's great  news, man," Kenneth said, sitting back. :: false
"Talking about me, I hope, boys," Janice said, returning with their drinks on a tray. :: false
She sat down, smiling. :: false
"Talking about the size of your overdraft, are we, dear?" :: false
"Gosh-darn," Rory said, snapping his fingers, looking at Kenneth. :: false
They left after that drink and went back to the house at Lochgair; Rory and Kenneth cleared a tangled choke of bushes and shrubs at the rear of the garden, where Mary wanted the lawn extended. :: false
They sweated through the insect-loud afternoon, while the sun shone. :: false
Janice sunbathed, and later helped Mary and Margot prepare the evening meal. :: false
Janice had taken that day off from the library. :: false
She and Rory left on the last train back to Glasgow that night. :: false
It was the last time Kenneth ever saw Rory. :: false
Fiona sat in the passenger seat of the car, watching the red roadside reflectors drift out of the night towards her. :: false
She was thrown against one side of the seat as Fergus powered the Aston round the right-hander that took the road out of the forest, down, into and through the little village of Furnace. :: false
She was pressed back against the seat as  Fergus accelerated again. :: false
They swung out and past some small, slower car, overtaking it as though it was stationary; headlights ahead of them glared, the on-coming car flashed its lights and she heard its horn sound as they passed, a few seconds later. :: false
The sound was quickly lost in the snarl of the Aston's engine. :: false
"If you're driving like this to try and prove something, don't bother on my account," she said. :: false
Look, I just want to get home as soon as possible. :: false
Yes, that would suit you fine, wouldn't it, Ferg? :: false
Pretend it hasn't happened, maybe it'll go away. :: false
She made a little fluttering motion with her hands, and in a high-pitched, girlish voice, said, "Disappear!" :: false
She looked at him; his broad, soft-jowled face looked hard and set in the dim light shining from the car's instruments. :: false
"They won't just go away, Ferg." :: false
She tried to make him look at her. :: false
He frowned, put his head slightly to one side and lifted it, trying to look round and over her head. :: false
"Nothing ever goes away, Fergus," she told him. :: false
She strained over a little more. :: false
He pushed her away with his left hand, back into her seat. :: false
She sat there, mouth open. :: false
He seemed to understand the silence and glanced over, a weak smile flickering on his face. :: false
"Don't you push me!" she said, slapping his shoulder. :: false
She hit him again. :: false
"Don't you ever dare push me again!" :: false
"Oh stop it, Fiona," he said, more exasperated than angry. :: false
Fiona slapped one palm off her forehead, then crossed her arms, looked away, out of the dark side window. :: false
I said something straight. :: false
I'm so sorry. :: false
I actually said what I meant, used the sort of word you'd normally only hear from your golfing chums or your rugby pals. :: false
Do you like her to talk dirty? :: false
"Does that get you going, Ferg?" :: false
"Fiona, I'm getting rather tired of this," Fergus said through his teeth, his fingers gripping the wheel harder, rubbing round it. :: false
I'm sorry you think what you do about Julie. :: false
"As I have tried to tell you, she was the wife of an old friend and I've kept in touch since she got divorced -" :: false
Oh yes, one of her sons has leukaemia, poor little kid, hasn't he? :: false
It's a joke, Fergus. :: false
Fiona gave a sort of strangled laugh, then put one hand up suddenly to her nose, and looked away, and sobbed once. :: false
Kenneth laughed. :: false
He sat back in his chair again, dragging it round so he was under the shade too. :: false
He chuckled. :: false
The Tree has some pretty weird ideas about religion; he might just swallow the idea he's been working for the devil all this time. :: false
Kenneth shrugged. :: false
"Maybe he could start thinking like a rational human being instead of a caveman frightened by lightning," Kenneth said tartly. :: false
"Oh, you're so cruel," Rory told him. :: false
"I know," Kenneth sighed, rolling the base of his glass around on the table top. :: false
"Sit down," Janice told him, taking his glass from his hand. :: false
Kenneth looked glum. :: false
The two men watched Janice head for the bar. :: false
"God, I hate it when you're mysterious!" :: false
Kenneth shook his head. :: false
What did Fergus ever tell you? :: false
Was it after you came back from India  that second time; before you went back to London? :: false
You two went hill-walking a lot then, didn't you? :: false
"We talked," Rory said awkwardly, using his fork to push bits of lettuce around his plate. :: false
I don't want to go into it, Ken, it would only complicate matters. :: false
"It's nothing that directly touches you." :: false
"What about Fiona?" :: false
"Did it touch her?" :: false
Rory looked away, across the loch. :: false
He shrugged. :: false
Look, Ken, it isn't something you'd benefit by knowing, all right? :: false
"Just leave it at that." :: false
The fork continued to shift the lettuce leaves around the plate. :: false
Kenneth watched his brother for a moment, then sat back. :: false
Let's change the subject. :: false
How's this new project thing coming along?" :: false
"Oh, I'm still working on it." :: false
"I wish you'd let me look at it." :: false
"It isn't finished yet." :: false
He put the fork down. :: false
Look; it's sort of a personal story ...  :: false
Rory leaned forward over the table, closer to his brother. :: false
"Look," he said, glancing round towards the french windows that led to the bar. :: false
Kenneth said, laughing in exasperation and throwing his arms wide. :: false
Rory sat back, shaking his head. :: false
He glanced up at Kenneth. :: false
Kenneth shook his head sadly. :: false
They might have happened by now if you'd just let me see  this... opera, TV series, pop-up-book, whatever the hell it is; and  if you'd let me talk to a few people. :: false
He ran a hand through his short, straight hair. :: false
This is my show; this is the way I want to do it. :: false
You should open up a bit more, share your problems. :: false
"Share some secrets." :: false
"I do," Rory said, biting his lip and looking down at his glass. :: false
"Rory," Kenneth said, sitting forward and lowering his voice to conspiratorial levels, "the last secret I remember you telling me was that it was you who set fire to that barn on the Urvill's estate." :: false
Rory grinned, stirring his finger through a little patch of moisture on the side of his glass. :: false
"Hey, I'm still waiting to see if you tell anyone." :: false
Tansley had experience in the tropics, having travelled to Ceylon (Sri Lanka), the Malay peninsula and Egypt in the years 1900-1. :: false
Although impressed with Clements' views, Tansley eventually challenged the super-organism interpretation of the community (see chapter 11). :: false
Lacking the sources of funding available in the United States, he had to arouse public support in order to establish ecology as an independent discipline. :: false
In 1904 Tansley and William Smith set up the Committee for the Survey and Study of British Vegetation, later known as the British Vegetation Committee. :: false
Tansley's pioneering Types of British Vegetation  of 1912 was a product of this expedition. :: false
In 1913 the British Ecological Society was founded, the first society in the world devoted to the field. :: false
The emergence of ecology as a science had no clear-cut links to the environmental movement that was advocating a reduction in the destructive activities required by modern civilization. :: false
Ecologists studied the natural environment, but often saw this only as a means of helping the human race to manage its interference more effectively. :: false
The relationship between the new science and earlier developments in biology also turns out to be remarkably complex. :: false
At one level, ecology was a reaction against the old natural history,  a determined effort to put field studies on a new, more scientific footing. :: false
Various groups exploited the rhetoric of modernization in their efforts to create new research programmes that could exploit the opportunities now being offered by the flood of government and private money available for scientific research. :: false
Yet there was no unity within ecology, just as there was no unity in the life sciences generally. :: false
In these circumstances, the tensions apparent within the philosophies of life available in the nineteenth century were able to perpetuate themselves into the twentieth. :: false
There was no dramatic switch to a materialist paradigm in science; materialistic and holistic/vitalistic philosophies both survived the transition to a more experimental approach to the study of life, at least temporarily. :: false
Those who ignored the role of adaptation were able to flourish at the same time as those for whom adaptation was the primary consideration, because the range of problems that could attract research funding allowed both approaches to find suitable niches for themselves. :: false
A new institutional framework for science was emerging, but far from imposing a conceptual unity, the network of academic, government and industrial research allowed a massive fragmentation of theoretical perspective. :: false
Each research school developed ideas that seemed consistent with its own set of problems and techniques. :: false
In these circumstances, many of the different philosophical perspectives that had flourished in the nineteenth century were able to update themselves and remain viable in the new age of professional specialization. :: false
The only way to get precision was to mark off an area and count every individual plant within it. :: false
Thus was born the technique of intense study of typical "quadrats" or squares marked off to define a sample of the vegetation for the surrounding area. :: false
Quadrats of a large scale had been used before to determine the precise range of various species, but Clements and Pound marked off small areas, often only a metre square, so that every plant of every species could be identified. :: false
In this way a precise sampling of the vegetation could be obtained, and, by setting up quadrats over a wide area, a systematic assessment of distribution could be worked out. :: false
By clearing a quadrat of all plants and then checking it periodically, the succession of plants leading to a mature sustainable "climax" vegetation could be observed. :: false
Pound and Clements' Phytogeography of Nebraska  of 1898 became a standard text for American botany, and Clements' Research Methods in Ecology  of 1905 was the first textbook to describe the new methodology. :: false
 Pound eventually abandoned botany for law, but Clements became professor first at Nebraska and then at Minnesota, before moving to the Carnegie Institution of Washington. :: false
Although originating in the universities, the new grassland ecology did not become a formal academic discipline, and flourished best among botanists with a practical concern for the problems experienced by the farmers who were interfering with the natural vegetation of the area. :: false
Clements was an influential writer who developed a philosophy of ecology that differed fundamentally from the reductionism of Warming and Cowles. :: false
Following the model of the social organism proposed by Spencer he adopted the view that the plant community was a genuine super-organism with a life of its own. :: false
The community was something more than a collection of species working together for mutual advantage - it obeyed laws that could only be understood at a level transcending that of the individual organisms. :: false
This is most apparent in his views on the development of a community through time. :: false
Clements was convinced that there was a single type of climax vegetation that formed the mature covering for any particular area, depending on the physical conditions. :: false
If anything disturbed that natural covering, the vegetation would follow a pattern of development that led through a series of recognizable stages to the mature climax once again: :: false
Succession must then be regarded as the development or life-history of the climax formation. :: false
It is the basic organic process of vegetation, which results in the adult or final form of this complex organism. :: false
All the stages which precede the climax are stages of growth. :: false
They have the same essential relation to the final stable structure of the organism that seedling and growing plant have to the adult individual. :: false
Clements had little interest in evolution. :: false
He thought that the prairie grassland climax had been stable since the last ice age and could be restored at any time even after interference  by humankind. :: false
Yet his language when discussing the development of the community is strongly reminiscent of the developmentalism typical of Haeckel and the progressionist evolutionists of the Darwinian era. :: false
Here the old belief that Nature tended to develop inevitably towards a predictable goal resurfaced in one of the newest branches of science, which had been designed to replace the old approach to natural history. :: false
Clements' holistic, almost vitalistic viewpoint was not linked to any romantic "back to Nature" environmentalism. :: false
On the contrary, it flourished within a discipline that had emerged to help the farmers who were struggling to exploit the prairies in a way that destroyed the traditional climax. :: false
Unlike the continental European ecologists, Clements was working within a system that emphasized practical rather than pure research and saw science as a way of controlling the economy as a whole. :: false
His appeal to the concept of a super-organism allowed him to present ecology as a science that would show us how to manage the natural productivity of an entire region. :: false
The grassland ecologists studied the development leading towards the natural climax as a way of helping farmers to understand the tensions created by their interference with the system. :: false
They offered the essentially optimistic message that nature was strong enough to resist destruction by human agencies - the climax could easily be restored if humankind chose to set aside areas for conservation. :: false
This optimism would be undermined by the Dust-Bowl of the 1930s, which showed that the destruction of the soil made possible by farming would have a permanent effect on the land, just as a follower of Warming's more materialistic approach might have predicted. :: false
Nevertheless, Clements' philosophy represents a notable extension of nineteenth-century developmental attitudes into the early decades of the new century. :: false
It suggests that "old-fashioned" vitalistic metaphors were quite capable of flourishing in an age that demanded that science have practical applications.  :: false
In Britain there was a tradition of plant geography supported by amateur activity. :: false
In the 1890s the brothers William and Robert Smith (1866-1928 and 1873-1900), influenced by the sociological approach of Patrick Geddes and by reading Warming's work, instituted botanical surveys of Scotland and of Yorkshire. :: false
But it was Arthur G. Tansley (1871-1955) who took over the leadership of the new approach, proclaiming ecology as the guide to future work in botany in a 1904 paper given to the British Association. :: false
These relationships were a natural consequence of evolution working to produce mutual interactions from which all the species involved would benefit. :: false
Warming was influenced by a movement within German science reacting against the idealists of previous generations who had sought mystical unities in Nature. :: false
He was a reductionist who believed that all the relationships he investigated could be explained in materialistic terms. :: false
Perhaps the clearest indication of this is his reluctance to postulate a single kind of community that was the "natural" occupant of any particular territory. :: false
He knew that wherever an unoccupied land surface was formed, by fire, landslip, the filling in of a bog, or human activity, plants moved in to colonize the area. :: false
There might be a succession of different communities, as when a bog is gradually converted to a meadow. :: false
But it would be wrong to suppose that the final community in such a sequence had some kind of privileged status that guaranteed its stability. :: false
Nature was a scene of constant struggle in which species were trying to extend their territory - a message emphasized by Darwin, but also by earlier writers such as de Candolle. :: false
This struggle is caused by endeavour on the part of species to extend their area of distribution by the aid of such means of migration as they possess. :: false
Millions upon millions of seeds, spores, and similar reproductive bodies are annually scattered abroad in order that species may settle in new stations; yet millions upon millions  perish because they are sown in places where physical conditions or nature of the soil check their development or where other species are stronger. :: false
The consequence of this pressure was that in some circumstances, at least, a community that was destroyed might never be re-established, because other species would invade the territory and prevent the original inhabitants reclaiming it. :: false
When humans cut down the forest, it might be replaced by a permanent grassland because the soil itself had been modified in a way that prevented the trees from reseeding themselves. :: false
Warming's materialism influenced one of the pioneering American plant ecologists, Henry C. Cowles (1869-1939) of the University of Chicago. :: false
Cowles developed an ecological approach within an academic framework that stressed rigorous pure research. :: false
He studied the changing vegetation around the shores of Lake Michigan, arguing that local factors such as the lake interfered with the natural plant covering characteristic of the region. :: false
As one moved away from the edge of the water, the plants changed systematically until eventually the natural woodland of the surrounding region was encountered. :: false
Cowles postulated that the sequence thus observed in space was equivalent to that observed in time when a section of lake was filled in and converted to dry land. :: false
The fact that the "natural" climax community for the region could be held at bay by geographical factors such as the presence of a lake showed that there was no super-organism designed to flourish in a particular region. :: false
The concept of the community as a super-organism was promoted most effectively by another school of ecological botany based on the study of the grasslands of the midwestern United States. :: false
This school had a different institutional framework based on applied research supported by agricultural stations, and had its roots in the European tradition of plant geography. :: false
Charles Edwin  Bessey (18451915) came to Lincoln, Nebraska, in 1884 as professor of botany at the state university and state botanist. :: false
He was a plant physiologist who had great success in promoting the study of botany as a science, but he was also concerned with conservation and wanted to study the grasslands of the prairie before they were completely destroyed by the plough. :: false
His most important student was Frederic E. Clements (1874-1926), who joined with Roscoe Pound (1870-1964) to begin the study of grassland ecology in the area. :: false
They read Drude's plant geography and decided to do a similar study, but soon found that the European techniques did not work on the almost featureless prairie. :: false
Bessey was sceptical of the whole approach as little more than revived natural history, and, in order to convince him that scientific ecology was possible, Clements and Pound looked for a method of quantifying their studies. :: false
They realized that the old technique of depending upon the trained observer's overall impression to characterize the natural vegetation of an area was unreliable. :: false
The botanists pushed ahead to develop a number of rival schools of ecology at the turn of the century. :: false
Historians have been most active in studying the emergence of plant ecology in the United States, but it is agreed that much of the initial inspiration for the American work came from Europe, especially from Germany and Denmark. :: false
In part, these European studies came from an extension of Humboldt's approach to distribution. :: false
Oscar Drude (1852-1933) of the Dresden botanical gardens published a plant geography of Germany in 1896, which sought to illustrate how local factors such as hills and rivers combined with the overall climate of a region to determine the actual distribution of plants. :: false
Drude attempted to depict the relative abundance of each species in an area according to a ranking system with categories ranging from "social" (where a single species formed an overall mass) down to "scarce". :: false
Other plant ecologists saw physiology as their starting point, because it was the interaction between the plant as a living organism and its environment that determined whether or not a particular species could live in a certain area. :: false
Only by studying how each species coped with different levels of moisture, heat, light, etc., was it possible to explain why the species flourished in one area but not in another. :: false
There was already a substantial body of information on plant physiology, but in the 1890s a number of botanists realized that the discipline could be extended to include how the plant coped with different environmental factors. :: false
Some of the inspiration for this move came from botanists who had travelled to the tropics and other exotic locations. :: false
The establishment of a botanical laboratory at Buitenzorg in Java was particularly influential. :: false
The greater prominence of physiology in geographical botany dates from the time when physiologists, who formerly worked in European laboratories only, began  to study the vegetation of foreign countries in its native land. :: false
Europe, with its temperate climate and its vegetation greatly modified by cultivation, is less calculated to stimulate such observations; in moist tropical forests, in the Sahara, and in the tundras, the close connexion between the character of the vegetation and the conditions of extreme climates is revealed by the most evident adaptations. :: false
Many of the botanists who studied the adaptation of species to extreme environments became convinced that the effect of the climate upon an individual plant could be transmitted to its offspring, thus building up the species' level of adaptation through a Lamarckian process. :: false
Perhaps the most influential of the European ecological botanists was the Dane, Eugenius Warming (1841-1924), whose Plantesamfund  of 1895 was translated into German the following year and into English as Oecology of Plants  in 1909. :: false
Warming was trained as a plant physiologist, spent some time in Brazil as a student, and finally developed his ecological approach as an alternative to both pure physiology and the sterile emphasis on classification of many field naturalists. :: false
He argued that the physical capabilities of the plant determined where it could or could not live, and studied the effects of various environmental factors, especially water, in determining the prevailing vegetation. :: false
But Warming also realized that the plants of a particular area formed a "community" united by a variety of interactions including parasitism and symbiosis (the mutual interdependence of two distinct species): :: false
The term "community" implies a diversity but at the same time a certain organized uniformity in the units. :: false
