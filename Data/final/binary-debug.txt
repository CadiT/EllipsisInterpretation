Not only is development of the new company's initial machine tied directly to Mr. Cray, so is its balance sheet. Documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the pending spinoff disclosed that Cray Research Inc. will withdraw the almost $ 100 million in financing it is providing the new firm if Mr. Cray leaves or if the product-design project he heads is scrapped.  :: true

Mr. Egnuss's dislike of program trading is echoed by many small investors interviewed by Wall Street Journal reporters across the country. But like Mr. Egnuss, few expect it to be halted entirely, and a surprising number doubt it should be.  :: true
J. Nicholas Hahn, Cotton Inc.'s president and chief executive, was an outspoken critic of WPP Group's acquisition of Ogilvy Group earlier this year. During the takeover, Mr. Hahn said he would put his account up for review if WPP's bid were successful, but he didn't.  :: true
If Brazil devises an economic strategy allowing it to resume growth and service debt, this could lead it to open up and deregulate its sheltered economy, analysts say, just as Argentinian President Carlos Saul Menem has been doing even though he was elected on a populist platform.  :: true
Some business analysts blame the problem on tough competition in the insurance market. They say insurance companies use policies aimed at excluding bad risks because their competitors do. But the general practice makes it more difficult to combine small groups of people into larger groups, thus spreading the risk over a larger base of premiums.  :: true
He said traders should be on the lookout for how metals producers react to this rally. "I expect to see some selling, but will they kill this one as they have every rally in the recent past " by selling and locking in prices for their production ?

Funds might be forced to accept lower prices if they expand their selling to the securities of less-creditworthy borrowers. And then, asset values of the funds could plunge more than they have so far.  :: true
"The offer will be sweetened, not because it has to be, but because it will make for a smoother transaction," Mr. Thorp said. "Dow Jones could bludgeon its way through the process and get it for less, but they won't do that. Dow Jones is not going to squeeze as hard as it could."  :: true
So why does Renaissance's computer like stocks with the Dow at 2653.28, where it closed yesterday, when it didn't with the Dow at 2200 ?  :: true
Some TV people doubt they will materialize and argue that even if they do, they won't offset the multimillion-dollar deficits that CBS could run up. " we've seen in the'80s," says Roger Werner, the president of the ESPN sports channel, "those deals can turn sour if the numbers don't work. And three years later, in a sea of red ink, the heroes can find themselves with a lot of explaining to do."  :: true
The state quit shoving peasants onto its subsidized farms over 30 years ago. But it never did let up on the pressure. Until recently, a farmer with no heir had to will the state his land to collect his pension. The pension's size still depends on how much produce he sells the state. His allotment of materials also did, until the state couldn't hold up its end of that bargain. Yet the state alone sells seeds and machines. When supplies are short, it often hands them over only in exchange for milk or grain.  :: true
But it is unfair to dump on teachers, as distinct from the educational establishment. I know many schoolteachers and, on the whole, they are seriously committed to conscientious teaching. They may not be among the "best and brightest " of their generation -- there are very few such people, by definition. But they need not be to do their jobs well. Yes, we all can remember one or two truly inspiring teachers from our school days. But our education proceeded at the hands of those others, who were merely competent and conscientious. In this sense, a teacher can be compared to one's family doctor. If he were brilliant, he probably would not be a family doctor in the first place. If he is competent and conscientious, he serves us well.  :: true
Thieves are going to find "anybody who has enough bucks to plant these things in their front yard," says William Morrissey, an investigator with the police department in Garden Grove, Calif., where five such thefts have been reported in the past several weeks. The department is advising residents to plant Sagos, if they must, in the back yard and telling nurseries to be on the lookout for anyone trying to palm one off.  :: true
So anyone buying the stock now is betting on some special transaction such as a recapitalization or takeover, and must do so using some guesswork about the likelihood of such an event.  :: true
Revenue-short states also are becoming more aggressive pursuers of tax delinquents, and perhaps none tracks them down with more relish than does New York since it acquired an $ 80 million computer system in 1985. The state's tax enforcers have amassed data bases from other New York agencies that license or register professionals and businesses ; from exchange agreements with the IRS, 24 other states, and two Canadian provinces, and even from phonebook Yellow Pages. Thus armed for massive matching of documents by computer, they single out high-income groups, looking primarily for people who haven't filed New York income-tax returns.  :: true
And don't expect anyone to change the term "blue chip," either, even though some of the companies that still enjoy the title may be riskier investments than they were. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., for one, is still a favorite of widows, orphans and trust departments -- but shorn of its regional telephone units and exposed to competition on every side, it is a far different investment prospect than it was before divestiture.  :: true
What complicates the scene in Cambodia is that the current regime is already communist, as are its Vietnamese overseers back in Hanoi, as are the Khmer Rouge -- who are the strongest of the three guerrilla groups. It's not clear which crew of communists might prevail in a coalition government, but the one good bet is that the non-communists would disappear. That would leave Hun Sen and the Khmer Rouge.  :: true
A force of younger pro-Gorbachev members in the East German bureaucracy has for some time been pushing for relaxation within their country. The older generation has been torn between a fear of tampering with the status quo and a fear of what might happen if they didn't.  :: true
As the story of "Mastergate " unfolds, we learn that the Internal Revenue Service confiscated one of the properties of a foreign financier who owes the government millions in taxes. The man, it seems, has a Lichtenstein corporation, licensed in Libya and sheltered in the Bahamas. He himself lives in a "consecutive series of unnumbered houses in a town in Switzerland." The property seized by the IRS is a Hollywood film studio, Master Pictures Incorporated ( MPI ). Supposedly the IRS will sell off the assets of MPI, but before it can, a lowly IRS agent is called into the hospital room of Wylie Slaughter, the dying head of the Central Intelligence Agency.  :: true
Currently in the middle of a four-week, 20-city tour as a solo pianist, Mr. Glass has left behind his synthesizers, equipment and collaborators in favor of going it alone. He sits down at the piano and plays. And plays. Either one likes it or one doesn't. The typical Glass audience, which is more likely to be composed of music students than their teachers, certainly does.  :: true

What keeps Mr. Li in Panzhihua ? Partly the system. While workers can't easily be fired, they also can't easily quit to find jobs elsewhere. The Li family could apply for permission to do so, but hasn't tried. "I expect I'll be in Panzhihua for the rest of my life," Mr. Li says. "The No. 1 high school is pretty good, and I have to think of my daughter's future."  :: true
In "Chicken Soup," Mr. Mason plays Jackie, a Jewish bachelor courting Maddie ( Lynn Redgrave ), an Irish widow and mother of three, against the wishes of his mother ( Rita Karin ) and her brother Michael ( Brandon Maggart ). It's worth noting that both disapproving relatives are immigrants. At least, they both speak with strong accents, as do Jackie and Maddie. It couldn't be more obvious that "Chicken Soup " is being made from an old recipe. And a safe one -- imagine if the romance in question were between an Orthodox Jew and a member of the Nation of Islam.  :: true
Still, such a pricing strategy just might appeal to people like Connie Bates, a respondent in the Journal survey. She recently walked out of a furniture store because the salesman offered to cut the price of a sectional couch three times. When a store keeps dropping prices, the Farmington, Mich., resident says, "I get suspicious that they're trying to get the most they can out of you."  :: true
