Not only is development of the new company's initial machine tied directly to Mr. Cray, so is its balance sheet.

But it is Mr. Lane, as movie director, producer and writer, who has been obsessed with refitting Chaplin's Little Tramp in a contemporary way. In 1976, as a film student at the Purchase campus of the State University of New York, Mr. Lane shot "A Place in Time," a 36-minute black-and-white film about a sketch artist, a man of the streets. Now, 13 years later, Mr. Lane has revived his Artist in a full-length movie called "Sidewalk Stories," a poignant piece of work about a modern-day tramp. Of course, if the film contained dialogue, Mr. Lane's Artist would be called a homeless person. So would the Little Tramp, for that matter.  :: VPE
I say " dialogue " because "Sidewalk Stories " isn't really silent at all. Composer Marc Marder, a college friend of Mr. Lane's who earns his living playing the double bass in classical music ensembles, has prepared an exciting, eclectic score that tells you what the characters are thinking and feeling far more precisely than intertitles, or even words, would.  :: VPE
The Artist has his routine. He spends his days sketching passers-by, or trying to. At night he returns to the condemned building he calls home. His life, including his skirmishes with a competing sketch artist, seems carefree. He is his own man.  :: VPE
To further load the stakes, Mr. Lane dreamed up a highly improbable romance for the Artist, with a young woman who owns her own children's shop and who lives in an expensive high-rise apartment building. This story line might resonate more strongly if Mr. Lane had as strong a presence in front of the camera as he does behind it.  :: VPE

But maintaining U.S. influence will be difficult in the face of Japanese dominance in the region. Japan not only outstrips the U.S. in investment flows but also outranks it in trade with most Southeast Asian countries ( although the U.S. remains the leading trade partner for all of Asia ). Moreover, the Japanese government, now the world's largest aid donor, is pumping far more assistance into the region than the U.S. is. While U.S. officials voice optimism about Japan's enlarged role in Asia, they also convey an undertone of caution. "There's an understanding on the part of the U.S. that Japan has to expand its functions " in Asia, says J. Michael Farren, undersecretary of commerce for trade.

He also is a consensus manager, insiders say. The decision to make the bid for Nekoosa, for example, was made only after all six members of Georgia-Pacific's management committee signed onto the deal -- even though Mr. Hahn knew he wanted to go after the company early on, says Mr. Correll. Associates say Mr. Hahn picked up that careful approach to management as president of Virginia Polytechnic Institute. Assuming that post at the age of 35, he managed by consensus, as is the rule in universities, says Warren H. Strother, a university official who is researching a book on Mr. Hahn. But he also showed a willingness to take a strong stand. In 1970, Mr. Hahn called in state police to arrest student protesters who were occupying a university building.  :: VPE
The framers hardly discussed the appropriations clause at the Constitutional Convention of 1787, according to Madison's notes. To the extent they did, their concern was to ensure fiscal accountability. Moreover, the framers believed that the nation needed a unitary executive with the independence and resources to perform the executive functions that the Confederation Congress had performed poorly under the Articles of Confederation. It would contradict that objective if the appropriations clause ( technically a limitation on legislative power ) could be read as placing the president on Congress's short leash, making the executive consist of the president and every member of Congress.  :: VPE
President Bush should veto appropriations acts that contain these kinds of unconstitutional conditions on the president's ability to discharge his duties and exercise his prerogatives. If President Bush fails to do so in his first year, he will invite Congress, for the remainder of his presidency, to rewrite Article II of the Constitution to suit its purposes. What becomes custom in the Bush administration will only become more difficult for future presidents, including Democrats, to undo.  :: VPE

Department economists don't expect 1989 to be as good a year as 1988 was. Indeed, net cash income is likely to fall this year as farm expenses rise and government payments to farmers decline.

In point of fact, volatility as measured by the annualized standard deviation of daily stock price movements has frequently been much higher than it is today. Periods before the advent of futures or program trading were often more volatile, usually when fundamental market conditions were undergoing change ( 1973-75, 1937-40, and 1928-33 for example ). It is interesting to see the fundamental stock pickers scream "foul " on program trading when the markets decline, while hailing the great values still abounding as the markets rise. Could rising volatility possibly be related to uncertainty about the economics of stocks, instead of the evil deeds of program-trading goblins ?  :: VPE

No wonder. We were coming down straight into their canal. See, the other rule of thumb about ballooning is that you can't steer. And neither can your pilot. You can go only up or down ( by heating the balloon's air with a propane burner, which does make the top of your head feel hot ) and ride the air currents. Which makes the chase car necessary. Most balloonists seldom go higher than2,000 feet and most average a leisurely 5-10 miles an hour. When the balloon is cruising along at a steady altitude there is little sense of motion.

These securities are attractive to Japanese investors for three reasons. First, they are safe. While they aren't backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, as Treasury bonds are, it is widely assumed that the government would support them if necessary. ( U.S. Treasury bonds are still the dollar-denominated investment of choice for long-term Japanese investors ). Second, they are liquid. The secondary market in federally backed mortgage securities now exceeds $ 900 billion, or nearly half of the $ 2.2 trillion in U.S. residential mortgages issued. Third, they offer high yields. At the moment, some offer as much as 1.6 to 1.8 percentage points over Treasury securities of similar maturities.  :: VPE
In addition, further packaging of mortgage-backed securities, such as Blackstone's fund, have reduced the effects of prepayment risk and automatically reinvest monthly payments so institutions don't have to.

Tax-exempt airport and street-corner solicitations were intended only to provide start-up funds. More stable industries were to build an economically viable infrastructure for the Moon movement in North America, as they had in Japan and South Korea.

Finally, I think it important to point out the extraordinarily high visibility of non-violent civil disobedience in these days of intensive media coverage. Give television a chance to cover live any breaking of the law, and no second invitation will be required. This brings into question the motives of those who lead civil disobedience demonstrations. Do they want the spotlight for themselves or for their cause ? Here is a good rule of thumb : If the movement produced the leader, the chance that he is sincere is much greater than if the leader produced the movement. In either case, ask yourself whether you have become better informed on the issues under protest by watching the act of civil disobedience. If you have not, it is probable that a thorough airing of the dispute by calm and rational debate would have been the better course.  :: VPE

But the Americans are also to blame. They long made little effort here. IBM, though long a leader in the Japanese mainframe business, didn't introduce its first PC in Japan until five years after NEC did, and that wasn't compatible even with the U.S. IBM standard. Apple didn't introduce a kanji machine -- one that handles the Chinese characters of written Japanese -- until three years after entering the market. Critics also say American companies charge too much. Japan's FTC says it is investigating Apple for allegedly discouraging retailers from discounting.  :: VPE

"Due to the earthquake in San Francisco, Nissan is donating its commercial air time to broadcast American Red Cross Emergency Relief messages. Please contribute what you can," the ad said. The Nissan logo flashed on the screen for a moment, and then came a taped plea for donations from former President Reagan -- followed by the silent print telling viewers where to call. Within two hours, viewers pledged over $400,000, according to a Red Cross executive.  :: VPE
Toyota's upscale Lexus division, a sponsor of the World Series, also put in a plug for Red Cross donations in a World Series game it sponsored. "The World Series is brought to you by Lexus, who urges you to help relieve the suffering caused by the recent earthquake...," the game announcer said. And New York Life made a plea for Red Cross donations in newspaper ads in the San Francisco area, latching onto the coattails of the Red Cross's impeccable reputation : "The Red Cross has been helping people for 125 years. New York Life has been doing the same for over 140 years."  :: VPE
Yesterday, Joel Zweibel, an attorney for Eastern's creditors committee, declined to comment on whether the experts had ever been instructed to look at other choices and whether they now were asked not to.

And to protect their reduced capital investment from eroding further, market makers became quicker to lower price quotes when sell programs are in progress.

The Brookings and Urban Institute authors caution, however, that most nursing home stays are of comparatively short duration, and reaching the Medicaid level is more likely with an unusually long stay or repeated stays.

But as astounding as the changes that have already occurred are, there is a fragility to glasnost. Censorship isn't a Marxist invention. The czars were no civil libertarians. As late as the 1890s, the Russian government prevented any coverage of famines. It even directed newspapers not to publish anything that might stain the honor of the Turkish sultan's wives. So glasnost is not a value woven with steel threads into the fabric of Russian society. It is an admirable public relations program initiated by a single political leader during a four-year blink of history. It is public relations of the highest sophistication, that recognizes that credibility is enhanced by honesty -- up to a point.  :: VPE

The marriage of news and theater, if not exactly inevitable, has been consummated nonetheless. News programs, particularly if they score well in the ratings, appeal to the networks' cost-conscious corporate parents because they are so much less expensive to produce than an entertainment show is -- somewhere between $400,000 and $500,000 for a one-hour program. Entertainment shows tend to cost twice that. Re-enactments have been used successfully for several seasons on such syndicated "tabloid TV " shows as "A Current Affair," which is produced by the Fox Broadcasting Co. unit of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. That show, whose host is Ms. Chung's husband, Maury Povich, has a particular penchant for grisly murders and stories having to do with sex -- the Robert Chambers murder case, the Rob Lowe tapes, what have you.  :: VPE

Accepted theories of asset pricing offer a perfectly legitimate explanation. Accepted theories state that investors require higher returns on riskier investments. Thus, rather than seeing the excess returns to the pro-selected portfolio as being abnormal, I see those returns as simply compensations for taking on added risk. I believe the risk for each individual stock selected by your pros is very large. If you asked me to select a stock with the highest expected return, I would select a stock with the greatest amount of undiversifiable risk, as I am sure your pros do. Your hypothetical investor is simply being compensated for taking on this added risk.  :: VPE

No doubt, Mr. Dinkins has been a calming influence. He is an avuncular figure who remembers the birthdays of colleagues' children, opens doors for women, and almost never has a bad word to say about anybody. More important, he emerged as a peacemaker last summer after the Central Park rape of a white jogger -- in which a group of Harlem teens was charged -- and the racial murder of a black teen-ager in the white Brooklyn neighborhood of Bensonhurst. Rather than scaring off white voters, as many predicted he would, Mr. Dinkins attracted many whites precisely because of his reputation for having a cool head.

As a critique of middle-class mores, the story is heavy-handed. But its unsentimental sketches of Cairo life are vintage Mahfouz. We see, smell and hear slums filled with "the echoes of hawkers advertising their wares interspersed with abusive language, rattling coughs and the sound of people gathering spittle in their throats and spewing into the street." And we meet engaging crooks, such as Hassan "the Head," famed for his head-butting fights, his whoring and his hashish. "God has not yet ordained that I should have earnings,' he tells his worried mother." Hassan comes to a bad end, but so does almost everyone else in the book.  :: VPE
Said's story reflects the souring of socialism under Nasser, whose dictatorial rule replaced the monarchy overthrown in 1952. By 1961, Mr. Mahfouz's idealism had vanished or become twisted, as it has in Said.

The idea of a child-as-required-yuppie-possession must be motivating them, since the wealthy offspring of their friends are shown to be rude brats, in therapy by age five.  :: VPE

The Soviet Union should keep these lessons in mind as it seeks to establish the ruble as an international currency. One way to make the ruble into a major international currency would be to leave reserves of gold and earning assets in a Swiss bank with distributions based on Swiss laws. Unless the laws determining the noteholder's rights to payment are independent of the issuer of those notes, however, a gold-based ruble would be as unsuccessful for the Soviets as it was for the czars.

The junk-mail titans, ever optimistic, are looking for ways around the problem. So far, they say, it hasn't had any noticeable effect on response rates. And before it does, they're trying to cut back on the clutter that created the situation in the first place. Among other things, the industry is trying to come up with standardized business lists that cut down on duplications. "We're going to have to mail a lot less and a lot smarter," says Jack Miller, president of Quill Corp., a Lincolnshire, Ill., business-to-business mail-order company. But then again, mailing less and smarter won't be much help if the mail ends up in the garbage anyway.  :: VPE
In 1986, some institute patients were reporting breakthrough seizures when they were switched from a specific brand-name medication to a generic one or from one generic manufacturer of a specific product to another. In addition, neurologists were beginning to report these observations as well. Call it anecdotal if you will. But no ethical physician would switch patients who were doing well on a specific medication from a specific manufacturer to prove a point.  :: VPE
"Traffic is certainly a concern, as is pollution, water and an adequate labor market," says Frank Sain, executive director of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Bureau. City fathers have managed to push through projects that are crucial for tourist growth, such as the expansion of McCarran International Airport to accommodate the 44 % of Las Vegas tourists who fly here. This year, by one means of transport or another, more than 18 million people will visit the city.  :: VPE
Will the investments pay off ? The growth of Las Vegas tourism in recent years persuades lenders that they will. Casino revenues and hotel occupancy rates are high.

The people with a stake in Nevada's gambling industry believe that they have barely tapped the potentially huge family trade.  :: VPE

The Morgan case thus tells us much more about the current state of sex, class, race and politics in our society than it does about the facts of Dr. Morgan's particular situation.

The Bank of England, on the other hand, had gold reserves that averaged about 30 % of its outstanding currency, and Bank of England notes were accepted throughout the world. The most likely reason for this disparity is that the Bank of England was a private bank with substantial earning assets, and the common-law rights of creditors to collect claims against the bank were well established in Britain. By contrast, in 19th-century Russia an authoritarian government owned the bank and had the power to revoke payment whenever it chose, much as it would in today's Soviet Union.  :: VPE

The burning question is whether the new chief can parry Mr. Icahn without being pushed into unwelcome moves. Mr. Corry might have to dismember the company more than he wants to. Or he might have to incur a huge expense of either buying Mr. Icahn's stock, possibly at a premium, or paying stockholders a special dividend partly because of Mr. Icahn's pressure.  :: VPE
With his recent purchases of USX common stock, Mr. Icahn shattered a three-year-old, unwritten standstill agreement with Mr. Roderick. In 1986, Mr. Roderick adroitly dodged Mr. Icahn's first bullet after the takeover specialist had built up an 11.4 % stake. Mr. Roderick did so by having USX redeem a series of guaranteed notes, a move that, in effect, raised the cost of a $ 7.19 billion Icahn bid by about $ 3 billion. And he managed to fend off further advances and even strike up an unlikely friendship with the interloper. Over dinners at New York's Sky Club and Links Club restaurants, the steel executive and the big investor talked steel, international trade and thoroughbred horses.  :: VPE
The 57-year-old tax attorney never even aspired to the job of chief executive. An undistinguished college student who dabbled in zoology until he concluded that he couldn't stand cutting up frogs, Mr. Corry wanted to work for a big company "that could do big things." But after joining the tax department of a USX subsidiary 30 years ago, he set the modest goal of becoming tax manager by the age of 46. For years, he quietly stuck to the back accounting rooms, wearing a hat to work because everyone else did. "I was never a rebel," he said in an earlier interview.

A Japanese apple called the Fuji is cropping up in orchards the way Hondas did on U.S. roads. By 1995 it will be planted more often than any other apple tree, according to a recent survey of six apple-industry sages by Washington State University horticulturist Robert Norton. Some fruit visionaries say the Fuji could someday tumble the Red Delicious from the top of America's apple heap.  :: VPE
Mr. Auvil, razor sharp at 83, has picked and packed a zillion pecks of apples over the past 65 years. He is known as the father of the U.S.-grown Granny Smith, a radically different apple that the conventional wisdom once said would never catch on. It did, shaking the apple establishment to its roots. Now, even more radical changes seem afoot as the grand old maverick of American apples plays the role of Hiroshi Appleseed. "The Fuji is going to be No. 1 to replace the Red Delicious," he says.  :: VPE
Supermarkets are getting into the variety act, too. They still buy apples mainly for big, red good looks -- that's why so many taste like woodchucks' punching bags. But freshness counts more than it once did, and stores are expanding shelf space for unconventional, but tastier, and often pricier, apples. " than sell 39-cents-a-pound Delicious, maybe we can sell 79-cents-a-pound Fujis," says Chuck Tryon, perishables director for Super Valu Inc., a Minneapolis supermarket chain and food distributor.  :: VPE
Instead of proposing a complete elimination of farm subsidies, as the earlier U.S. proposal did, the new package calls for the elimination of only the most tradedistorting ones.

The new goal of the Voting Rights Act -- more minorities in political office -- is laudable. For the political process to work, all citizens, regardless of race, must feel represented. One essential indicator that they are is that members of minority groups get elected to public office with reasonable frequency.

It is a quick fix for a complex problem.  :: VPE
By not choosing one of these options, Israelis will condemn themselves, as the Maronites did, to perpetual war with the Muslims in their midst, and so to the internal erosion of their state.

But that is not much of a consolation to draw from the failure of General Aoun.  :: VPE
The volatility inherent in program trading troubled other traders, too. They don't like the risks they are forced to assume when prices swing so drastically. Market makers are supposed to keep supplies of stocks on hand to maintain orderly trading when imbalances occur. That means that on days when prices are tumbling and sellers abound they must be willing to buy shares from sellers when no one else will. In such an environment, a market maker can absorb huge losses.  :: VPE

Poland's 2.7 million small private farms cover 76 % of its arable land. On it, a quarter of the country's 39 million people produce three-quarters of its grain, beef, eggs and milk, and nine-tenths of its fruit, vegetables and potatoes. Like the Roman Catholic Church, the Polish peasant is a pillar of the nation. Try as they might, the Communists could neither replace nor break him. And they did try.  :: VPE
The state quit shoving peasants onto its subsidized farms over 30 years ago. But it never did let up on the pressure. Until recently, a farmer with no heir had to will the state his land to collect his pension. The pension's size still depends on how much produce he sells the state. His allotment of materials also did, until the state couldn't hold up its end of that bargain. Yet the state alone sells seeds and machines. When supplies are short, it often hands them over only in exchange for milk or grain.  :: VPE
The stock market's precipitous drop frightened foreign investors, who quickly bid the dollar lower. But as stock prices recovered some of the early losses, so did the U.S. currency.

Given the prelude's thematic connections with the music preceding the last act, the idea is more worn than bad, though as luck would have it, for a change there actually was a conductor in the pit whom we wanted to hear, Carlos Kleiber, trying to make memorable music while we all waited for the bed lump to stir into song.

Despite their ubiquity, the consultants aren't entirely welcome. Some lawyers and scholars see the social scientists' vision of the American jury system as a far cry from the ideal presented in civics texts and memorialized on the movie screen. In the film classic "Twelve Angry Men," the crucible of deliberations unmasks each juror's bias and purges it from playing a role in the verdict. After hours of conflict and debate, that jury focuses on the facts with near-perfect objectivity. In real life, jurors may not always work that way, but some court observers question why they shouldn't be encouraged to do so rather than be programmed not to.  :: VPE

That's a lot of banishment, as it turns out.

But it is unfair to dump on teachers, as distinct from the educational establishment. I know many schoolteachers and, on the whole, they are seriously committed to conscientious teaching. They may not be among the "best and brightest " of their generation -- there are very few such people, by definition. But they need not be to do their jobs well. Yes, we all can remember one or two truly inspiring teachers from our school days. But our education proceeded at the hands of those others, who were merely competent and conscientious. In this sense, a teacher can be compared to one's family doctor. If he were brilliant, he probably would not be a family doctor in the first place.

The suites are air-conditioned, have wet bars and plush seating, and offer a clear view of the field -- all for a sale price of $475,000 to $ 1 million, depending on their size and location. Mr. Jones has been taking prospective suite owners onto the field during practice to let them rub elbows with players, and promises those who actually buy one of the rooms an insider's look at the team's strategy before game time. The sales job seems to be paying off : When he bought the team, only six of the suites had been sold. Today, 30 have.  :: VPE

Three International Cash Portfolios funds, which invest almost exclusively in bonds and money-market instruments overseas, were among the four top-performing funds in the latest week. Because the funds' investments are denominated in foreign currencies, their value expressed in dollars goes up when those currencies rise against the dollar.

All three funds posted negative returns for the year to date.  :: VPE

The new technologies are intended to retire the cathode-ray tube, which accounts for most of the bulk of the conventional TV set. Replacing the cathode-ray tube with a large, thin screen is the key to the creation of a high-definition television, or HDTV, which is expected to become a $ 30 billion business world-wide within a decade. Large U.S. companies are interested in other segments of the HDTV business, such as signal-processing and broadcast equipment. But except for Zenith Electronics Corp. and International Business Machines Corp., which is collaborating with Toshiba on computer displays, they are poorly positioned to exploit advances in large panels. General Electric Co. recently sold off its interests in liquid-crystal displays to Thompson-CSF of France. "We found the market not developing as we thought it would," a GE spokesman says.  :: VPE
Thus far, almost all of the basic technology relating to high-definition television has come from U.S. laboratories.

With this personal strategy firmly in place, I look forward to years of fine life-style investments and increasing widespread leverage. My kids' college education looms as perhaps the greatest future opportunity for spending, although I'll probably have to cash in their toy portfolio to take advantage of it. But with every step I take, I'm building wealth. You can, too, if you, like me, refuse to bite the bullet. So go out there and eat that debt.

So do just about all the losses that could be attributed to the sheer incompetence of unqualified planners. Nobody can estimate the toll, but John Gargan, a Tampa, Fla., planner and head of one trade group, the International Association of Registered Financial Planners, thinks the danger to investors from incompetence is "humongous," far greater than that from crookery. His group, like others, wants minimum standards applied to all who call themselves financial planners.  :: VPE
Other cases go to show that an old saw still applies : If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Certificates of deposit don't pay 23 % a year, for example, but that didn't give pause to clients of one Alabama planner. Now they're losers and he's in jail in Mobile County. CDs yielding 40 % are even more implausible -- especially when the issuing "bank " in the Marshall Islands is merely a mail drop watched over by a local gas-station operator -- but investors fell for that one too.  :: VPE
It never hurt anyone, that is, unless the growth funds don't grow when you need them to. Or the zero-coupon bonds turn out not to have been discounted deeply enough to pay your kid's tuition. That's the dilemma for today's parent. Although many experts are advising risk, no one has a good answer for you if the risk doesn't pay off.  :: VPE
The issue here may be the soundness of the guarantee. Prepayments, much like mutual-fund purchases, are pooled for investment.

Revenue-short states also are becoming more aggressive pursuers of tax delinquents, and perhaps none tracks them down with more relish than does New York since it acquired an $ 80 million computer system in 1985.

Mr. Daly in his affidavit acknowledges that Warner agreed to release the producers last year to take over MGM but says that situation was altogether different.

The individual foreign policy carried out by U.S. legislators adds to a confusing U.S. performance that has emboldened Soviet initiatives in Central America. On Oct. 3, following conversations with Secretary of State James Baker, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze arrived in Managua to acclaim "Nicaragua's great peace efforts." There, Mr. Shevardnadze felt legitimized to unveil his own peace plan : The U.S.S.R. would prolong a suspension of arms shipments to Nicaragua after the February election if the U.S. did likewise with its allies in Central America. He also called on Nicaragua's neighbors to accept a "military equilibrium " guaranteed by both superpowers.

While this theory is exceedingly simple, it appears to explain several things. First, why ticket splitting has increased and taken the peculiar pattern that it has over the past half century : Prior to the election of Franklin Roosevelt as president and the advent of the New Deal, government occupied a much smaller role in society and the prisoner's dilemma problem confronting voters in races for Congress was considerably less severe.  :: VPE

Today a President can still send up spending rescissions, but they're meaningless unless Congress has a guilty conscience and changes its mind. This is like asking foxes to feel remorse about chickens, and naturally rescissions are almost never approved. In 1987, President Reagan sent 73 rescissions back to the Hill, but only 3 % of the spending total was approved by Congress. Senator Coats's proposal would let the proposed spending cuts take place automatically unless Congress acts. The Members could still try to serve their constituents with special-interest goodies, but the police ( in the form of a President ) would be there with a straitjacket if they really get crazy, as they do now.  :: VPE

As we know, voters tend to favor Republicans more in races for president than in those for Congress. In every presidential election over the past half century, except for the Goldwater presidential candidacy, the GOP has captured a greater percentage of the major-party popular vote for president than it has of congressional seats or the popular vote for Congress. Prior to 1932, the pattern was nearly the opposite.  :: VPE
Is there any empirical support for this theory ? Three pieces of evidence corroborate the key assumption that Democratic legislators are more willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Republican colleagues. First, economists James Bennett and Thomas DiLorenzo find that GOP senators turn back roughly 10 % more of their allocated personal staff budgets than Democrats do. To the extent that the primary duty of personal staff involves local benefit-seeking, this indicates that political philosophy leads congressional Republicans to pay less attention to narrow constituent concerns.  :: VPE
Second, if the key assumption is valid, Democrats should have lower attendance rates on roll-call votes than Republicans do to the extent that such votes reflect national policy making and that participating in such votes takes away from the time a legislator could otherwise devote to local benefit-seeking. This is indeed what the data indicate, particularly in the case of the House. The Democratic House attendance rate has not exceeded the Republican House attendance rate since 1959.  :: VPE
Moreover, ticket splitting appears to take the same peculiar pattern at the state government level as it does at the federal level. State government is more typically split along Republican-governor\ lines than the reverse. A cross-state econometric investigation, furthermore, reveals that, holding other factors constant, the difference between a state's major-party vote going to the Republican gubernatorial candidate and the Republican share of the lower state house is a positive function of the state tax rate.  :: VPE

Sassy already has recovered ; circulation has quickly passed the500,000 mark and advertising pages have stabilized this year at more than 300.

The problem is one that East Germany shares with other half-states, such as North Korea, but one it must shoulder alone in the East Bloc. When Poland moves to reform, it can at least lean on its past : However flawed and short-lived Joseph Pilsudski's interwar republic, it was a nonsocialist democracy. Czech reformers can recall the Wilsonian ideals of the same period in their country. Even the Soviet Union has Peter the Great to rediscover, should it choose to. But East Germany is merely "the land of truly existing socialism." Beyond that, it has to compete with West Germany for a claim to the German identity. Up to now, the main weapon of the "worker and peasant state " has been the ideology of socialism.  :: VPE
SUGAR : Futures prices extended Tuesday's gains. The March delivery ended with an advance of 0.16 cent a pound to 14.27 cents, for a two-day gain of 0.3 cent. According to one dealer, Japan said it has only40,000 tons of sugar remaining to be shipped to it this year by Cuba under current commitments. The announcement was made because of reports Tuesday that Cuba would delay shipments to Japan scheduled for later this year, into early next year. The dealer said the quantity mentioned in the Japanese announcement is so small that it's meaningless. One analyst said he thought the market continued to be supported to some degree by a delay in the Cuban sugar harvest caused by adverse weather. The dealer said India might be the real factor that is keeping futures prices firm. That country recently bought200,000 tons of sugar and had been expected to seek a like quantity last week but didn't. "It's known they need the sugar, and the expectation that they will come in is apparently giving the market its principal support," the dealer said.  :: VPE

With the February 1987 U.N. accords " to Afghanistan," the Soviet Union got everything it needed to consolidate permanent control. The terms of the Geneva accords leave Moscow free to provide its clients in Kabul with assistance of any kind -- including the return of Soviet ground forces -- while requiring the U.S. and Pakistan to cut off aid. The only fly in the Soviet ointment was the last-minute addition of a unilateral American caveat, that U.S. aid to the resistance would continue as long as Soviet aid to Kabul did. But as soon as the accords were signed, American officials sharply reduced aid. In February 1989, when the Soviets said they had completed their pullout, the U.S. cut it further.  :: VPE

The magazine had its best year yet in 1988, when it celebrated its centennial and racked up a 17 % gain in ad pages, to 283.

Despite his racial advantage, to be a great butler is a heroic calling ; one's pantry is " unlike general's headquarters during a battle." If, for example, in the midst of a great social occasion ( such as an international conference on revising the Versailles Treaty in 1923 ), one's 72-yearold father, himself a great butler once, should happen to die of a stroke, one must continue to serve the port : " don't think me unduly improper in not ascending to see my father in his deceased condition just at this moment. You see, I know my father would have wished me to carry on just now." It is this kind of dignity and restraint that allows Stevens to declare : " all its sad associations, whenever I recall that evening today, I find I do so with a large sense of triumph."

Then, to make matters worse, computerized sell programs kicked in, hammering stocks into steeper losses. There was heavy stock-index arbitrage, as traders sold big baskets of stock and bought stock-index futures to profit from the price discrepancies between the two markets. This was a hangover from Friday, when Standard & Poor's 500-stock index futures had closed at a sharp discount to stocks.

Then at 10:15 the Dow suddenly started to rebound, and when it shot upward it did so even faster than the early-morning fall. And this time, it wasn't just the program traders who were responsible.

COPPER : Futures prices fell and showed little rebound as one major labor problem that had been underpinning prices appeared to be solved. The December contract declined 3.05 cents a pound to $ 1.2745. Prices were down from the outset of trading on concern that a drop in the stock market might create a weakened economy and a consequent reduction in copper use. But the recovery in the stock market provided little help for copper as word spread that a three-month strike at the Highland Valley mine in British Columbia was about over, according to an analyst. Highland Valley is a large Canadian producer and principal supplier to Japan, which recently began seeking copper elsewhere as its inventories shrank. Last week it was reported that company and union negotiations had overcome the major hurdle, the contracting out of work by the company. Now, the analyst said, only minor points remain to be cleaned up. " all intents and purposes, an agreement appears to have been achieved," he said. Copper inventories in New York's Commodity Exchange warehouses rose yesterday by 516 tons, to10,004 tons. London Metal Exchange copper inventories last week declined13,575 tons, to89,300 tons. The LME stocks decline was about as expected, but the Comex gain wasn't. However, this was brushed aside by concern over the stock market, the analyst said. At one point in futures trading, as the stock market firmed, the December contract rose to as high as $ 1.2965, but it wasn't able to sustain the gain. "It was simply overbought," he said, and selling by funds that are computer guided helped depress prices.  :: VPE

Factory officials estimate that more than 10 % of the work force here is redundant, but layoffs aren't allowed. Even factory workers' children are guaranteed jobs. The industrial monoliths are so deeply involved in the welfare system that China's leaders may never be able to modernize them, despite their glaring economic inefficiency. Though the Panzhihua factory itself is profitable, many such enterprises aren't. Subsidies for money-losing enterprises totaled $ 18 billion last year, or about one-third the total state revenue.  :: VPE
What keeps Mr. Li in Panzhihua ? Partly the system. While workers can't easily be fired, they also can't easily quit to find jobs elsewhere. The Li family could apply for permission to do so, but hasn't tried. "I expect I'll be in Panzhihua for the rest of my life," Mr. Li says. "The No. 1 high school is pretty good, and I have to think of my daughter's future."  :: VPE
The Fed allowed the key federal funds interest rate to dip to about 8 5\ % from its levels of just below 9 % last week. That was a sign to financial markets that, at least for now, the Fed was easing its grip on credit. Because the markets remained relatively calm, however, the Fed didn't have to inject massive amounts of money into the banking system, as it did in October 1987.  :: VPE
"I do not regard the amount of the decline on Friday as unexpected or unlikely," he said in a telephone interview. " the market being up to2,700 or2,800 and the existence of derivative products... one can expect volatility of the magnitude we had."  :: VPE
Those sound like innocuous changes, but they're not. Both the Treasury and Congress traditionally have pushed for easy money, the Treasury to reduce its debt management problems and Congress to satisfy powerful producer constituencies who want a weak dollar for short-term competitive gains in world markets. Congressional pressures on the Fed similar to those that produced the savings and loan mess are an awful thought.  :: VPE
Easy money advocates, however, are adept at spreading economic myths. There is the constant insistence that the Fed could lower interest rates were it not so obstinate. The Fed indeed can lower short-term interest rates by pumping reserves into the banks, but it can't do much about them from there on. If the reserves generate inflation, which is what the Fed fears most right now, interest rates will go up as lenders demand a premium. Enough inflation can ultimately even wipe out the bond market, as it did in Britain in the 1970s, thereby crippling the economy.  :: VPE
These two myths have caused the republic untold damage. The U.S. economy took on an inflationary bias when the Fed was forced to finance an incredible spending spree by Lyndon Johnson. Richard Nixon exacerbated the problem when, in response to pressures from Congress, he applied price and wage controls in August 1971, thereby discouraging production. Jimmy Carter ultimately hired Mr. Volcker to kill inflation, which was reaching dangerous levels. He did, too late to save Mr. Carter from forced retirement.  :: VPE
The claim that inflation generates economic growth is seductive. In fact it does the opposite. As the charts show, the 1975-80 inflation destroyed both productivity and economic growth ( see accompanying charts -- WSJ Oct. 17, 1989 ). It was only after Mr. Volcker killed inflation, at the cost of a sharp but brief recession, that growth and productivity started rising once more. Producers were forced by the discipline of sound money to slash away organizational fat and acquire more efficient equipment. After having performed that admirable feat, however, they were back in 1985 demanding a dollar devaluation that would make it still easier for them to compete in international markets. They got the devaluation and, as is usually the case, began picking up fat again. So now they want another one.  :: VPE
Authorities, including the Bank of England and the Securities Association, are gearing up in case a crisis wallops the London market. The bank was in touch with other major central banks over the weekend and was preparing to make capital available to dealers if needed, as it did in the 1987 crash, according to people familiar with the bank's strategy.  :: VPE
Many are quick to emphasize that just because the market can fall as fast as it did Friday doesn't mean it will tank again, despite some disquieting similarities between now and October 1987. As in 1987, this latest market slide was preceded by sparring between nations and government officials over the dollar.  :: VPE
If foreigners dump U.S. stocks and return to the safety of their home markets -- as they did in October 1987 -- they must simultaneously also sell dollars for their own currencies. Those transactions, in turn, could weaken the dollar. Even if foreigners just withhold from buying additional U.S. securities, they reduce the demand for dollars.  :: VPE
America West, though, is a smaller airline and therefore more affected by the delayed delivery of a single plane than many of its competitors would be. "I figure that American and United probably have such a hard time counting all the planes in their fleets, they might not miss one at all," Mr. Otradovec said.  :: VPE
Major oil companies in the next few days are expected to report much less robust earnings than they did for the third quarter a year ago, largely reflecting deteriorating chemical prices and gasoline profitability. The gasoline picture may improve this quarter, but chemicals are likely to remain weak, industry executives and analysts say, reducing chances that profits could equal their year-earlier performance.  :: VPE
But securities analysts say Phillips will be among the companies hard-hit by weak chemical prices and will probably post a drop in third-quarter earnings. So, too, many analysts predict, will Exxon Corp., Chevron Corp. and Amoco Corp.  :: VPE
"It hasn't had any impact on us, nor do we expect it to," said a spokeswoman for Miller Brewing Co., a major client of Backer Spielvogel.

The Bronx has a wonderful botanical garden, a great zoo, its own charming Little Italy ( on Arthur Avenue ) and, of course, the Yankees.

Then there's "The World Today," the prime-time newscast featuring Mr. Shaw and Ms. Crier. Until now, CNN has featured its Hollywood gossip show during the key evening period. But 70 % of the cable-television-equipped households that watch news do so between 6:30 p.m. and 7 p.m., the network discovered, so CNN wants in. Mr. Amos says the Shaw-Crier team will probably do two live interviews a day, with most of the program, at least for now, appearing similar to CNN's other newcasts.  :: VPE
While some in the U.S. contend that advertising is the bane of television, here many believe that its absence is to blame for the European TV industry's sluggish development. Until recently, national governments in Europe controlled most of the air time and allowed little or no advertising. Since production costs were guaranteed, it didn't matter that a program couldn't be sold abroad or put into syndication, as most American programs are. But not much money was spent on the shows, either, a situation that encouraged cheap-to-make talk and game shows, while discouraging expensive-to-produce dramas.  :: VPE

If Mr. Mason had used less derogatory language to articulate his amateur analysis of the voting behavior of his fellow New Yorkers, would the water be quite so hot ? It probably would, because few or none of the people upset by Mr. Mason's remarks have bothered to distinguish between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used insulting language. In addition, some of Mr. Mason's critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of racism.  :: VPE
Don't say the TV sitcom, because that happens to be a genre that, in its desperate need to attract everybody and offend nobody, resembles politics more than it does comedy. It is true that the best sitcoms do allow group differences to simmer : yuppies vs. blue-collar Bostonians in "Cheers " ; children vs. adults in "The Cosby Show." But these are not the differences that make headlines.  :: VPE
In "Chicken Soup," Mr. Mason plays Jackie, a Jewish bachelor courting Maddie ( Lynn Redgrave ), an Irish widow and mother of three, against the wishes of his mother ( Rita Karin ) and her brother Michael ( Brandon Maggart ). It's worth noting that both disapproving relatives are immigrants. At least, they both speak with strong accents, as do Jackie and Maddie. It couldn't be more obvious that "Chicken Soup " is being made from an old recipe. And a safe one -- imagine if the romance in question were between an Orthodox Jew and a member of the Nation of Islam.  :: VPE
Yes, he did. As I watched him on C-Span, I heard him speak those lovely words about the Bill of Rights, which he quotes from the transcript of the hearings.

Market makers keep supplies of stock on hand to maintain orderly trading when imbalances occur. On days like Friday, that means they must buy shares from sellers when no one else is willing to. When selling is so frenzied, prices fall steeply and fast. Two years ago, faced with the possibility of heavy losses on the stocks in their inventories, market makers themselves began dumping shares, exacerbating the slide in OTC stock prices.  :: VPE
"There are some very significant issues out there, such as the fiscal deficit, the trade deficit, our relations with Japan, that have to be the subject of major initiatives," he said in an interview. "I'd like to see that initiative, and I haven't. There isn't a big shot, an agenda."  :: VPE
Surveys suggested that consumer confidence was high before Friday. A 190-point drop isn't likely to make much of a dent ; multiply that a few times over, though, and it will. If the reactions of executives gathered Saturday at Hot Springs, Va., for the Business Council meetings are typical, business leaders weren't overly rattled by Friday's decline. And if foreign investors become a tad more cautious -- well, the dollar's recent strength suggests that the U.S. can stand it.  :: VPE
A rebound in energy prices, which helped push up the producer price index, is expected to do the same in the consumer price report. The consensus view expects a 0.4 % increase in the September CPI after a flat reading in August.  :: VPE

While the network currently can operate freely in Budapest, so can others. In addition, competition for listeners is getting tougher in many ways than when broadcasting here was strictly controlled. Instead of being denounced as an evil agent of imperialism, Radio Free Europe is more likely to draw the criticism that its programs are too tame, even boring.  :: VPE
What is one to think of all this ? Doctrine and special interests govern some responses. People eager to have youth " their dues to society " favor service proposals -- preferably mandatory ones. So do those who seek a "re-energized concept of citizenship," a concept imposing stern obligations as well as conferring rights. Then there are instinctive opponents. To libertarians, mandatory service is an abomination and voluntary systems are illegitimate uses of tax money. Devotees of the market question the value of the work national service would perform : If the market won't pay for it, they argue, it can't be worth its cost. Elements of the left are also reflexively opposed ; they see service as a cover for the draft, or fear the regimentation of youth, or want to see rights enlarged, not obligations.  :: VPE
Good service programs require recruitment, screening, training and supervision -- all of high quality. They involve stipends to participants. Full-time residential programs also require housing and full-time supervision ; they are particularly expensive -- more per participant than a year at Stanford or Yale. Non-residential programs are cheaper, but good ones still come to some $10,000 a year. Are they worth that ? Evaluations suggest that good ones are -- especially so if the effects on participants are counted. But the calculations are challengeable.  :: VPE
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was on the telephones, making it clear to officials in the U.S. and abroad that the Fed was prepared to inject massive amounts of money into the banking system, as it did in October 1987, if the action were needed to prevent a financial crisis.  :: VPE
Sony found a new market niche, but Mr. Kaye figured that its prices left plenty of room for a lower-priced competitor.

Now, dozens of corporations, including Ethan Allen, TW Services and York International, that are counting on at least $ 7 billion of scheduled new junk financings to keep their highly leveraged takeovers and buy-outs afloat, may never get the money.

As the days go by, the South African government will be ever more hard pressed to justify the continued imprisonment of Mr. Mandela as well as the continued banning of the ANC and enforcement of the state of emergency. If it doesn't yield on these matters, and eventually begin talking directly to the ANC, the expectations and promise raised by yesterday's releases will turn to disillusionment and unrest. If it does, the large number of right-wing whites, who oppose any concessions to the black majority, will step up their agitation and threats to take matters into their own hands.  :: VPE
South Korea is " important to us now, both economically and in terms of security," says Sen. Richard Lugar ( R., Ind. ), the former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ", many Americans don't think much about Korea. But the miracle of their economic growth and the development of democracy -- imperfect though it is -- are very important to the United States." One major topic during Mr. Roh's visit will be human rights. Due process still is denied in South Korea ; a few months ago, Kim Dae Jung, the major opposition leader, was detained and interrogated for 20 hours by security thugs. Just as Pope John Paul II did in Seoul last week, President Bush and members of Congress ought to tell Mr. Roh in no uncertain terms that this kind of behavior is unacceptable.  :: VPE
It's appropriate for U.S. officials to keep hammering for more open trade policies, as U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills did in Seoul last week. But there's also sometimes a tendency in American political circles to pick especially on South Korea, out of frustration over our inability to do much about Japan. That's counterproductive.  :: VPE
Still, such a pricing strategy just might appeal to people like Connie Bates, a respondent in the Journal survey.

But now, with Bull in firm control, these U.S. operations are key ingredients in Mr. Lorentz's plans to ensure that Bull remains one of the half-dozen or so world-wide, full-range computer companies likely to survive the 1990s. To do so, Bull is planting itself firmly in the U.S., where, says Mr. Lorentz, a lot of the best people and research are. The Zenith buy means Bull will derive 22 % of its revenue from the U.S. -- up from 18 % previously -- and the company spends 30 % of its 3.64 billion-franc research and development budget in the U.S.  :: VPE
" " through the Beijing massacre ? This is the buzzword Adi Ignatius chooses to characterize in his review of my book "Tiananmen Diary : Thirteen Days in June " ( Leisire & Arts, Sept. 8 ).

The first part of the remark was tautologous (show me a peaceful terrorist); and the second was untrue: Gerry Adams had just lost his West Belfast constituency. :: NPE-O
As the novel's second part charts Shimomura's exploits in his adopted western lands, the third reflects Roshan's childhood in Punjab and Bombay, among Hindu, Sikh and Parsee friends. :: NPE-O

The first is his education: we find in the first two books of The Prelude those experiences which Wordsworth regarded as formative. :: NPE-O
The second was his residence in France during the French Revolution: this direct encounter with the main movement of the age led Wordsworth into constant political agony and debate, and it is significant that one of the main characters in The Excursion , his other long poem, is the Solitary, a despondent figure disillusioned by the failure of the Revolution.  :: NPE-O

The following century the Greek system of dating by successive Olympiads from the first in 776 BC was begun, either by the historian Timaeus of Sicily or by Eratosthenes, the famous librarian of the Museum in Alexandria and measurer of the earth, and later Greek chronology was based upon it.  :: NPE-O

Although the English savant Roger Bacon deciphered the composition of gunpowder in the thirteenth century, it was used in the twelfth by the Moors in wars in Spain and so was probably known to the troops of Barbarossa, perhaps as a terrible Moorish secret weapon.  :: NPE-O
The period between the end of the twelfth century and the middle of the thirteenth saw several crucial innovations in weaponry and armour which helped make the medieval knight what he was always intended to be: a superb fighting machine.  :: NPE-O

Nail on the Banister by R. Stornaway, alias R. Scott, is an eloquent Scots joke of the Thirties, and it allows one to say that Glasser's banister was a bed of nails, but that his slides may have been less painful than Fraser's. :: NPE-P
He could well have been called a victim, and his book consigns itself, as Fraser's does, to that large literature in which the sufferings of victims are recounted: but he does not see himself as a romantic orphan. :: NPE-P
Glasser's vapours are different from Fraser's. :: NPE-P
They stink, while Fraser's are mental.  :: NPE-P
With the James, we are told who did it; in the Ackroyd, the matted fellow who is the chief suspect is never very securely identified as the author of the crimes � it is almost as if the inspector could have done it: so that Ackroyd's is an authorially uncertain work in which the authorship of its crimes is uncertain too. :: NPE-P
A little earlier, a view of Eliot's has been paraphrased: that �there is no �truth� to be found� in the world, �only a number of styles and interpretations � one laid upon the other in an endless and apparently meaningless process�. :: NPE-P

A linguistic point was made in the course of the review � that Julian Ormerod's lounge-bar slang is �continuous, in a way, with Patrick's cool utterance� � and the review also made out that Ormerod's overdone good heart is continuous, in a way, with Jenny's. :: NPE-P
Philip Roth's contribution to The Facts is (as distinct from Nathan Zuckerman's) significantly milder, in relation to family matters, than what we get in these abrasive comic fictions: but then the fictions can be nice too. :: NPE-P

Its position on abortion itself was hardly ambiguous: the minutes of the Assembly meeting for 1982 point out �[the Assembly's] opposition to abortion on demand for purely social reasons, or as a means of birth control � [and] that in exceptional circumstances, where medical abortion might be necessary, the most stringent safeguards should be provided to prevent abuse� (Presbyterian Church in Ireland 1930�86, General Assembly (1982), p. 61). :: NPE-P

The illustration of double ropes being used to protect a second on a traverse is incorrect; the drawing of a double-fisherman's knot is actually of a single-fisherman's; the section on rigging anchors seems very sketchy with no consideration of using the rope to equally load them, rather than slings; different types of shunt are discussed for self-protection on abseils but there is no mention of the cheap, simple prussik knot as an alternative, or the even more effective French prussik linking the controlling rope to the leg-loop of the harness.  :: NPE-P
We didn't like the food, we preferred Mum's. :: NPE-P
Danilov, The Voice observed, had probably not even begun to contemplate his murder when Dostoevsky was shaping Raskolnikov's. :: NPE-P

Stepan Verkhovensky kits himself up with umbrella, travelling-bag, walking stick, broad-brimmed hat, belted overcoat and top-boots like a hussar's; and � Quixote overlaid for English readers by Pickwick, the White Knight, Mr Toad � he talks the language of �high adventure� and the open road: �there's a great idea in the open road too!�  :: NPE-P
He lived in 1935 (when I last saw him) in the utmost simplicity, although if he had been a little more conciliatory he could always have earned enough for his comfort � and his wife's; but he never valued anything that money could buy as he valued the integrity of his sharp-shooting mind. :: NPE-P
The masterly masculinity of �cuff� may be thought to belong with Dryden's conception of the grand style more than with Virgil's. :: NPE-P
Tate, so devoted to Eliot's precedent, appears to have dismissed as amiably perfunctory the respect that Eliot, not quite consistently but repeatedly, accorded to Pound's prose-writings and Pound's literary opinions; and � so it might be argued, though this is not the place for it � Tate's own verse, and the verse of those he influenced, were the worse for having taken note of Eliot's precedent without attending equally to Pound's. :: NPE-P
Guide to Kulchur gives us Pound at his most personal, at his most deliberately vulnerable; it is here that we find him wondering aloud, for instance, if the body of his work to that date could be mentioned in the same breath with Thomas Hardy's. :: NPE-P

Thus, perhaps without realising the implications, the Soviet parliament gave the go-ahead for the most revolutionary experiment here since Lenin's New Economic Policy of the 1920s: for a massive delegation of powers from the centre, permitting a single republic to create its own market-oriented economy, with its own budget, and to redraw economic rules which basically Stalin's. :: NPE-P

Tortured between the city and the savage, Eliot's was a nightmare world.  :: NPE-P
In 1924, though, Eliot has come to perceive The Golden Bough as a �stupendous compendium of human superstition and folly�, seeing in it increasingly less �interpretation�, so that it has become �a statement of fact� which is not involved in the maintenance or fall of any theory of Frazer's. :: NPE-P

This is the densest, yet at the same time one of the most persuasive sections of the book, wherein a variety of arguments drawn from the analytic tradition are deployed against Nietzsche's lineage: Quine and Davidson on a theory of meaning both holistic and realist � demonstrating that there are more ways out of atomism and the myths of the given than Saussure's; and an anti-relativist notion of truth as a �regulative ideal� derived from Tarski, Popper and Lakatos. :: NPE-P

As Mr Khalil points out, the arch is both a literal image of Mr Hussein (those are his arms and no one else's), and a giant reflection of how he sees himself.  :: NPE-P

The practical problems are that there may be no evidence of violence on the woman's body, which usually means that the case will be a question of the victim's word against the defendant's; this may lead the police to be sceptical of the woman's complaint, or may incline the prosecutor to accept a plea of guilty to the lesser charge of indecent assault. :: NPE-P

Now erm <pause> oh you've got a pen. Excellent. :: FactMod
The way it works is that the theory, the theory actually erm er has four dimensions. Mm. :: Ack

Erm and er the other thing about it is that although we have to look at, in order to discover the preference, we have to look at each dimension as a discrete entity, once you've found the preferences, they actually have a dynamic relationship with each other. Right. :: Ack
works. Okay? :: CheckQu

if you have R ten times what it was in the <trunc> pres </trunc> the previous one, you'll now only get a tenth of the current out. Yeah. :: Ack

In fact there were very few guide dogs at that time and erm I've never felt that erm it's, I mean maybe <pause> just my <pause> erm silliness really but I, I never wanted a dog lying about all day because once at the office I stayed put as it were until it was time to go home and I could have taken the dog I suppose during the lunch hour but I preferred that time to erm to reading Mm. :: Ack
and just relaxing and erm in any case as I say er guide dogs were few and far between at that time Mm mm. :: Ack
and I've never wanted one since because er luckily I've got erm my wife who, we get about together. Mm. :: Ack
Yes it's erm <pause> it was seventy five pounds a year at age nineteen Mm. :: Ack

I think it was about forty four Mm. :: Ack
but of course erm as a sort of public to the er, er a gesture to the public erm but one stage during the war when things were getting a bit grim on the war front, it was decided that erm, we should work extra hours as erm, <unclear> to show that we were pulling our weight <shift new=laughing> <unclear> <shift>, so we used to, instead of starting at nine o'clock until erm half past five, and working on Saturdays as well of course, erm, we had to start at half past eight and finish at six and it was a bit of a fiasco really because nobody erm, you know, well the end of the half past five you were pretty well tired out so erm the rest of the time <pause> Mm. :: Ack
you were really kicking your heels and erm quite apart from which in the winter time the er conditions were pretty grim because they had the erm anti-splinter netting over the windows and erm big blinds which had to be drawn as soon as it was dusk because er, of course you weren't allowed to show a light and erm if that was <unclear> it became really thick Mm. :: Ack
mm, I don't think the cleaners were all that erm good at their job, I mean they, they were, er perhaps that's a bit unfair to them to say that because erm the collection of dust was erm <shift new=laughing> pretty dreadful <shift> Mm. :: Ack

found it <trunc> v </trunc> very difficult cos erm atmosphere as I say was erm really dreadful Mm. :: Ack
it got very hot and erm stuffy and unpleasant Mm. :: Ack
so erm, and that went on for, I suppose till the end of the war when er, when we had a reduction in hours again, we went back to the normal nine till half past five. Mm. :: Ack

Very, very little really, erm we had contact with other Authorities of course, in the course, in erm er particularly in connection with evacuation, erm <pause> evacuation took up erm quite a lot of staff and, and time at that er particularly initially because erm Suffolk was in a peculiar position or at least the East Suffolk was, erm at the beginning of the war of course erm East Suffolk was an evacuation, er was erm a reception area Mm. :: Ack

but erm it had sorted itself out after, well more or less after a week or two a lot of the evacuees of course didn't stay very long, they went back home because erm <pause> I know mother had a, a little boy from erm Guildford when we lived at Debenham and er he went back after a while, the mother used to come down and visit him from time to time, they were very, came from very poor circumstances and the Mm. :: Ack

<unclear> sheet. Broadsheet. :: RepAck
Peter, would you like to talk about language register in tabloids and broadsheets? Okay. :: AffAns
But very often I think tabloid journalism is interesting in terms of language <unclear> because it's very punchy it's succinct because <trunc> i </trunc> <trunc> i </trunc> in some of our terms you might find people into a three minute reader and a thirty minute reader <pause> because in attention span and intellectual capacity are quite different <pause> but to actually condense something <pause> into meaningful short bursts, even if they are politically biased actually requires a certain amount of skill I would suspect <vocal desc="clears throat"> the clarity index which I can't find is the process that I mentioned the other night where you take <pause> erm some people call it the fog index <pause> a <pause> correct me if I'm wrong in my figures, but I think it's a piece of something like two hundred or three hundred words <pause> you count the number of <trunc> suc </trunc> erm colons and full stops or is it only full stops?

Full stops. Full stops. :: RepAck
You then count the number of words of more than two syllables Mm. :: Ack
I mean like I saw a double-decker bus on the moon and that sort of stuff. Mm. :: Ack
It may be highly critical that the actual language will be completely different in the register. Yes. :: Ack
They will go for vocabulary which is highly charged with imagery and emotion. Mm. :: Ack
The others will chip in if they agree, but they will <pause> they are, they are wanting to set a missile to move, they're wanting to send a bullet, they are wanting to <trunc> s </trunc> to evoke emotion or anger or rage or frustration or political bias or to change attitudes now for example the interesting thing about the Princess Diana erm the headline on one of those tabloids which talks about exile <pause> is I suspect that they want to evoke the constitutional crisis which there was at the time of <pause> Edward. :: Filler
There was a special dispensation given to her to attend and in fact there were photographs at the time with the Queen with her. Yes. :: Ack
But, but, but the whole social and cultural <pause> revolution evolution change has led I think to <pause> whole different schisms in the press which perhaps may have existed in some of the very one might almost say near communist publication like the <unclear> Daily Worker. :: Filler
You'd be there six o'clock gone mate. Wonderful. :: FactMod
You see one of the other interesting things is that there is a <pause> essentially a tradition in this country that the Royal Family do not sue newspapers Yes. :: Ack
There are various exceptions erm <pause> and there have been two or three in recent years, but it therefore meant that they were fair game for saying anything <pause> so they were fair game for a very sensational headline <pause> because there was very little chance of recrimination. Mm. :: Ack
Now the view er was that they were dignified and above taking action <pause> and also in the sense that the public was credited I think with more sense than to believe everything <pause> and that the public memory is relatively short and therefore if you start a court action and you then have coverage in the court action, you are merely making the thing <pause> worse <pause> erm sometimes the things that some people may have thought were highly actionable one day, become almost a joke and something of affection later on and you can, one of the classics maybe is about the Prince of Wales talking to his plants, now that <unclear> a national joke and he will make jokes about it in speeches Mm. :: Ack

I think that that is, is something that you know we looked at the <unclear> you know the Mirror that you know while thirty years ago they were doing short punchy stories and they maintained that, that there was actually <pause> A wider range of vocabulary  :: Filler

She's very concerned and the present line partial though it be, represents a <pause> a blight situation on that, on the, on potential er occupants of that line <pause> and certainly erm <pause> I find myself more in <pause> in er agreement with Darcy's views than I do with the other two councillors of East Grinstead, that's not er not secret No, no no  :: Reject
I, I think Chairman that as, as we come out of the recession <trunc> an </trunc> and <pause> <trunc> th </trunc> that the overall erm level er quantity of development taking place increases, then we are almost bound to see perhaps more affordable housing erm in absolute terms, although I don't see any opportunity of there being a <pause> a major hiccup in proportional terms, so I, I, like you, I think I remain er pessimistic er regarding the, the, the overview, although we might see er a turning up of the er of the graph having been bumping along the bottom for a little time a little while. Yes, thank you Chairman. :: Ack
Basically erm I agree with what you say but that the County Council itself of course is <pause> a landowner of erm some quite attractive erm areas of land that could be used for below cost housing, but the problem in the past has been that they always had to sell erm at the <pause> market price.

Erm let's <unclear>, if they say sketch a graph, Right. <u who=PS3SR> :: Ack
What would be the interesting parts of the shape? Where it crosses through the X and Y axes. :: ShortAns_arg
Where it crosses through the X and Y axes. Okay, X and Y axes, anything else that might be an interesting point? <pause> :: RepAck
So, sketching a graph is not the same as plotting one. Mm. :: Ack
Any idea what that graph would be? <pause> X squared. :: ShortAns_arg
Erm, what would <pause> <unclear> not quite the right shape <unclear> <pause> what would that graph be? Y equals something <pause> plus X squared. :: ShortAns_arg
And there might be, it would be something X squared, and there might be something X and er well there's definitely a constant Mm. :: Ack
So that's going to be minus something Mm. :: Ack
What about this one? Y equals X squared. :: ShortAns_arg
It's gonna be about plus three, three plus. Mm. :: Ack
Where's the X, where's the Y? X squared. :: ShortAns_arg
So it'll be something like <pause> X minus three X squared. Mm. :: Ack
So X equal three or X equal three. Yeah. :: Ack
Y would be six, <unclear>. <pause> Mhm. :: Ack
What's Y equal to, roughly? Just over six, six point :: ShortAns_arg
Just over six, six point Six and a bit. :: RepAck
What does it approximate to? Erm minus infinity. :: ShortAns_arg
<pause> at minus a million. Erm :: Ack
What would that approximate to? A million plus six. :: ShortAns_arg
Now, there's a Y equals X squared. Yeah. :: Ack
So around here, round this bit, <pause> there won't be any difference. Hmm. :: Ack
Erm <pause> people might say oh well we'll take it from minus five to plus five. Yeah. :: Ack
But you'd miss a lot of important points. Yeah. :: Ack
But you're still missing out a big, very important part of the graph, because for a lot of its range it actually, you know, looks something like well what would that look like? <unclear> <pause> Ten times. :: ShortAns_arg

It's the same <unclear> Right. :: Ack
So <trunc> wh </trunc> when X is very big well, say, when it's big compared to ten Yeah. :: Ack
this looks like Y equals minus X squared. <pause> Mm. :: Ack
It's where most people throw it away on the sketches, they just pick a tiny, tiny portion and look at that in great detail, say ah, look at that, wonderful. Mm. :: Ack
Tt, erm plotting graphs, you had one question didn't you where they asked a gradient? Yeah. :: AffAns

of advertising Mhm. :: Ack
we are really er I'm preaching the company policy and also something I know that er works Mhm. :: Ack
Right no qualifying in in in er I will tell you what the <unclear> erm er sort of policy on that or opinion on that is that if you have got er a closure on the phone. Mhm. :: Ack
Now you must have at some time or other in advertising closed the deal on the phone. Oh yeah mhm. :: Ack
Well that's that's what we mean by that. Right. :: Ack
I have I would say that most of the people who answer yes who have been in say for instance home improvements Mhm. :: Ack

When you say those you mean the golf cards? Yeah. :: AffAns
That that type of idea. Right. :: Ack
Well er er erm the the whole point of about asking that sort of question is that er I in my own mind I know where I think Yeah. :: Ack
Er now we've got but we do have two products there of equal standing in terms of product er sorry of of erm salary potential Mhm. :: Ack

Erm I know some companies actually sell send the large ones out Yes. :: Ack

I have to say though first of all especially if they have the larger version Mhm. :: Ack
Well thing is people are moving to an area they may be given some information by their company but Mhm. :: Ack
You'd still be in estates division Yeah. :: Ack
Erm but in the end it's all estates division anyway. Yeah. :: Ack
Er while I'm having a look through this er Richard er over there we have erm a selection of the product selection of the product which erm we discussed briefly on the phone. All right. :: Ack
There's a signature coming up is there? erm certainly the average cost of an ad if you took the most expensive and the least expensive across all of those products would come out somewhere in the region of six hundred pounds. Per ad? :: CE
Per ad? Per ad. :: RepAffAns

If you look at a full page when they happen, they don't happen all that often on a schools portfolio which costs two thousand two hundred pounds, you'll see there's there's already three different prices Yeah. :: Ack
So you will go in you will never come out of a an advertiser with less commission than that. Right. :: Ack
Unless you have discounted it and you give two or three pounds away when you do that. Right. :: Ack
But in the main we are looking for er somewhere in the region of er hundred and eighty pounds per per per deal and we're looking for one of those a day average. Mhm. :: Ack
Our top people earn top money because A they're not satisfied with one deal a day. Mhm. :: Ack

But I've actually spoken to an even a a real Tyne and Wear Geordie accent Yes. :: Ack

er so it wouldn't be any good for us. Mhm. :: Ack
I say well it's definitely the latter. The latter. <vocal desc=laugh> :: RepAck
