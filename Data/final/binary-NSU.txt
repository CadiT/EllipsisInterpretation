Cos I've put it up. <vocal desc=laugh>  Yes. :: true
But we haven't introduced each other have we? No. <vocal desc=laugh> :: true
<pause> We're involved in some other organizations as well <pause> would you mind <trunc> s </trunc> going next? Yes. :: true
<pause> Margaret's husband. <pause> Margaret. :: true
<pause> Anne said she worked in a factory at one time. Popcorn factory? <vocal desc=laugh> :: true
Would that be okay for you David? Yeah. <pause> :: true
The final paragraph on <unclear>  Erm <trunc> i </trunc> erm on the first page, I'm sorry. :: true
What am I supposed to do? Yeah. :: true
Do you know what the product was? KitKat. <pause> :: true
<pause> Another thing I found out today was <pause> do we know where our <trunc> m </trunc> main supplier of our coffee is? Which country? :: true
Which country is er the biggest single supplier of coffee to this country. <pause> Kenya. :: true
Which country is er the biggest single supplier of coffee to this country. <pause> Yemen. :: true
Which country is er the biggest single supplier of coffee to this country. <pause> Brazil. :: true
It's Uganda. Uganda. :: true
And another sixteen percent is the other <trunc> Ne </trunc> Nestle coffee <pause> erm Blend Thirty Seven which I used to drink a long time ago and others <vocal desc=laugh> and twenty two percent is er <pause> Maxwell. :: true
And you want to know whether it would be more expensive. Mhm. :: true
I mean, Nestle had to abandon that. Mhm. :: true
I mean, Nestle had to abandon that. Yes. :: true
Well, yes, I suppose one of the questions you could ask is, is there a boycott against the company? Right. :: true
They moved the Hoover factory from France to Yes. :: true
It's really a question of finding out where the material is coming from and knowing what the conditions are like there. Mm. :: true
Some things they're obliged to tell you where those come from aren't they? Yes. :: true
I have thought of a question. Good. :: true
Erm because as Moira said that Kraft is erm <pause> now what was she saying, what was she saying Kraft is the same as <pause> Craft? :: true
Erm because as Moira said that Kraft is erm <pause> now what was she saying, what was she saying Kraft is the same as <pause> Traidcraft? :: true
Traidcraft? No. :: true
Erm because as Moira said that Kraft is erm <pause> now what was she saying, what was she saying Kraft is the same as <pause> Maxwell. :: true
I think I'll give you some homework that you could do for the week. Right.  :: true
based on, what we do today will be based on Okay. :: true
How many notes are there in a scale? Eight. :: true
Eight. Right. :: true
So each one of those is going to have a <pause> a name of its own Yeah. :: true
You, you've probably heard that name before. Yeah. :: true
Or in the key of G it would be A. A. :: true
<pause> The mediant is the third degree of the scale Yeah. :: true
Dominant means that it's important doesn't it? Yeah. :: true
So that becomes submediant. Right. :: true
So the dominant is five notes above the tonic and the subdominant is five notes below the tonic. Right. :: true
So the dominant is five notes above the tonic and the subdominant is five notes below the tonic. Yeah. :: true
That <trunc> jus </trunc> if, if you can keep the <pause> <trunc> th </trunc> the descriptions in your mind as well it just helps you to, to remember why each one is called that. Yeah. :: true
Did you have to go as far as that? No. :: true
No.  Right. :: true
No.  Okay. :: true
C to E major third. Major third. :: true
But it is actually called a perfect octave as well. Okay. :: true
You have C to D flat. :: true
That becomes a minor second. Right. :: true
Fourths and fifths you don't have minors.  Right  :: true
That's the sixth. Minor sixth. :: true
So you've then got a minor second, a third, a sixth and a seventh. Right. :: true
must have, if it hasn't got another letter name then it's not a second is it? Yeah. :: true
Now you can also have diminished intervals for the fifths and fourths. Alright. :: true
C to A would be <pause> A double flat which would on a keyboard be a G. G. :: true
Do you have to go through the minor? No. :: true
bigger. Oh yeah. :: true
So it's going the other way. Right. :: true
So that would be a D sharp. A D sharp. :: true
Which is two whole semitones less than the major interval Yeah. :: true
And then you're gonna have a minor interval from each of the major intervals. Yeah. :: true
A diminished interval from any of the intervals. And an augmented from any of the intervals as well. :: true
And an augmented from any of the intervals as well. Right. :: true
Let's call it by its proper name, tonic. Tonic. :: true
Augmented fifth would be a C sharp. Right. :: true
C flat. C flat. :: true
That's a fourth. Oh yeah. :: true
That's right. Yeah. :: true
That's right. Okay. :: true
That's what we normally use it for and erm <pause> what I'm going to do if that's okay is I, I'll describe the erm <pause> the actual theory to you Mm. :: true
And I've got a little chart that I'll give you to do that on. Mm. :: true
And then erm we'll have three readings, really, of erm <pause> where you come Mm. :: true
One of which is this erm estimate that you'll do now. Mm. :: true
And then you've filled in a works situations Mm. :: true
questionnaire, and that gives us another reading. Mm. :: true
And then there's the proper questionnaire and I've scored that up. Right. :: true
So we get three readings. Okay? :: true
Now erm <pause> oh you've got a pen. Excellent. :: true
The way it works is that the theory, the theory actually erm er has four dimensions. Mm. :: true
And the idea is that that's the midpoint and there's a one to ten scale going each way. Mm. :: true
And the theory is that every individual has an innate inborn preference for behaving at one end or the other. Okay? :: true
Are you right or left handed? Right handed. :: true
How did you feel while you were trying <shift>? Er really strange actually. :: true
and er I have a real problem with using my left hand. Oh interesting. :: true
Erm and er the other thing about it is that although we have to look at, in order to discover the preference, we have to look at each dimension as a discrete entity, once you've found the preferences, they actually have a dynamic relationship with each other. Right. :: true
works. Okay? :: true
works. Okay. :: true
This, this dimension is about er where you prefer to focus your attention and where you get your psychological energy from. Okay? :: true
Erm and then, they may share. Right. :: true
to write, or something to buy in town, or whatever you know Mm. :: true
They thought it over and they've worked out, and they're not gonna come. Right. :: true
Do I put a cross? Yes. :: true
It's about perception. Mm. :: true
And erm prefers to focus on future possibilities rather on present reality. Mm. :: true
<vocal desc=laugh> and erm feeling on the right. Feeling? :: true
Feeling? Yeah feeling. :: true
So it's a very logical impersonal sort of approach. Okay? :: true
Do you do you get an idea? Yeah. :: true
And they don't like it. Yeah. :: true
You due a line today? Yeah. :: true
Time fairly belts in doesn't it? Mm. <pause dur=8> :: true
<pause> There we are, scallywag. Right. :: true
You're full of catarrh. Mhm. :: true
You think so? Yeah. :: true
Just, just, just go home and go to bed. Aha. :: true
And even if I go to bed I can't sleep. Aye. :: true
You think so? Yes. :: true
I mean, anybody says boo to me, I'm bubbling. Aye. :: true
But er we'll see you in four weeks. Four weeks? :: true
Four weeks? Four weeks. :: true
I want to see that you're coming along alright. Right. :: true
Peace and quiet after that. Aye. :: true
Peace and quiet after that. For a for a wee while. :: true
For a for a wee while. For a wee while, yes.  :: true
Er, it's a wee problem I've had for a <pause> say about a year now. Mhm. :: true
I seem to get an awful lot of, it's like Aha. :: true
dry flaky skin. Yeah. :: true
and under my chin. Mhm. :: true
all different stuff, it's no good. No. :: true
Right, let's get it cleared for you. Good. :: true
I think I left it too long. No no. :: true
I should have seen you afore now. No. :: true
You'll need to watch your soap, Aha. :: true
Yeah I thought it was soap. Mhm. :: true
Er shampoos. Shower gels and things like that? :: true
So what, what would you recommend that? <trunc> We </trunc> <trunc> ba </trunc> Johnson's Baby Shampoo. :: true
<trunc> We </trunc> <trunc> ba </trunc> Johnson's Baby Shampoo. Aha. :: true
Because it's got the, it's the one with the fewest er <unclear> detergents, Aye. :: true
and you use this stuff for about a month <pause> use this <unclear> stuff is quite soft. Aha. :: true
This is highly perfumed stuff. Aha. :: true
<pause> Just a wee drop like that. Mm. :: true
I, I've <unclear> tubes of that E forty five, Aye. :: true
and I plastered it, Aye. :: true
Aye, just watch the kind of soap you use, Aha. :: true
I'll write a letter to Chris <unclear> And other people. <u who=PS1WT> :: true
And other people. <u who=PS1WT> Not to other people. :: true
Not to other people. Right. :: true
so I know what I'm talking about? Yes. :: true
I would try F ten. Just press F ten? :: true
Just press F ten? Yeah. :: true
If you press N N? :: true
Erm what do you want to call it? Mumsy. <u who=PS1WU> :: true
Erm what do you want to call it? Letter to mum. :: true
Erm what do you want to call it? Mum. :: true
Erm what do you want to call it? Mumsy. <vocal desc=laugh> :: true
Call it mumsy then. Mumsy? :: true
Oh so if you press enter it'll come down one line. Enter. :: true
Oh so if you press enter it'll come down one line. Or return. :: true
Or return. That one? :: true
That one? Yeah. :: true
<pause> That's it, that's delete, that one's backspace. Right. :: true
And then if you put your initials. <vocal desc=laugh> My initials. :: true
You can guess who the typist is. S L P. <pause> :: true
And what's the subject? Letter. :: true
What are, what's the main point of the letter, what's it about? Love. :: true
Love. Okay. :: true
<unclear> press Y? Yeah. :: true
Now do you know how to print? <u who=PS1WT> Shift F seven. :: true
Now do you know how to print? <u who=PS1WT> Shift, shift F seven. <u who=PS1WS> :: true
Pardon? F seven. :: true
F seven. With shift or not? :: true
With shift or not? No, just F seven on its own. :: true
Cos you've already saved it. Right. :: true
No I don't think it's this do you? No. :: true
Try F one F one again and we'll get <u who=PS1WU> Shift and F one? :: true
Shift and F one? No just F one F one. :: true
And now shift F seven. F seven. :: true
I haven't <trunc> she </trunc> pressed shift there we are. Right. :: true
Ah no we haven't discussed it yet. <vocal desc=laugh> Oh superb. :: true
What was it German and French? No French and standard Dutch. :: true
Sorry what were the erm things that related to personality? Intelligence and suitability and particular occupations. :: true
And second one is a book by <sic resp=LONGMAN> Beardsmoor </sic> and he <unclear> sheep says about <shift new=laughing> the Canadian <trunc> soc </trunc> social <shift> psychologist  :: true
Erm that's <trunc> a b bit </trunc> too But it's it's about <pause> Appalachian English? <unclear> Appalachian. :: true
Appalachian. Okay. <vocal desc=laugh>  :: true
Who's this book by? Luhmann L U H M A double N. :: true
In such social social settings linguistic differences become important boundary markers that require careful cultivation. Good. :: true
Erm <pause> it's talking about glide reduction. What what reduction? :: true
What what reduction? Glide. :: true
Glide. Glide? :: true
Glide? Yeah. :: true
Erm <pause> Oh yeah substitution of A for What's that with an A and a U <unclear>? Er ow? :: true
Er ow? Ow. :: true
<unclear> I'm a little bit confused <unclear> there and I can't get it out. Honest. :: true
Honest. Okay. :: true
What is it on WordPerfect? Hm. :: true
Yes, but with differences and we don't always <unclear> the same message. Okay, right. :: true
Has anyone got any other things to add to that? No. :: true
<pause dur=10> Has anyone read anything about turn-taking in conversation? Yes. :: true
and you erm <unclear> you know your next big <unclear> and the <unclear> mean a <unclear> signals as to whether or not it sort of the floor's being offered. Mhm. :: true
Whereas women hardly ever overlapped <unclear> Mhm okay. :: true
What's Can you remember what the point in a conversation is where a speaker has a chance to to become a new speaker? T R P :: true
Erm the the <unclear> somebody speaking includes erm address someone to make it really obvious who the next speaker's going to be. Mhm. :: true
Er women were also said to be polite, diffident, verbose and deferential, which What all of those? :: true
What all of those? Mhm. :: true
I'm not saying this is actually correct but this is the traditional view. Okay. :: true
I'm not saying that the same person thought of these two things at once, but Okay. :: true
And then they kept their language <unclear> kept the language. Right. :: true
Erm Well not that I've come across yet <unclear> I'd rather do something that's <unclear> getting the facts and then giving examples. Mhm. :: true
<vocal desc=laugh> There <unclear> Oh that's why we're not doing it any more, so what do we have to do instead of having to do an essay <unclear>? Just an essay. :: true
Oh, they decided not to give us quite so much work? Mm. <unclear> :: true
Got to do a marathon tomorrow. Why? :: true
I'm I'm I'm a bit confused. Your doing what? :: true
I'm I'm I'm a bit confused. Historical linguistics? :: true
pile you've got there. That five there? :: true
No but how much do you think they cost? A fortune I expect. :: true
How much do you think? Three hundred pounds. :: true
Three hundred pounds. More. :: true
How much do you think? A thousand pounds. :: true
A thousand pounds. More. :: true
How much do you think? Eleven hundred quid apparently, just that. :: true
Who's produced them? <u who=PS270> Golly. :: true
Who's produced them? <u who=PS270> Somebody anyway. :: true
Who's produced them? <u who=PS270> Oh Andrea Andrea <gap reason=anonymization desc="last or full name"> :: true
She didn't even say, This is what it is. Yeah. :: true
I want to know what, <unclear> work with <sic resp=LONGMAN> unemploye-ed </sic>, is. Unemploye-ed. :: true
I taken one thing, I think there's one here Allan. Mhm. :: true
Was that had we and I know we mentioned it when we met last time, but was that really we're including in E O work with the unemployed . Mm and presentation skills. :: true
I <trunc> won </trunc> I wonder about, on interviewing skills for all staff, Mm. :: true
What do you want to call it? Just careers guidance. :: true
And it's called enhanced careers guidance. Individual careers guidance actually. :: true
So it's it's enhanced careers guidance. For individuals. :: true
It's it it's more than sort of a ten minute slot in a staff meeting. Yeah. :: true
I think, one was <pause> summaries of guidance, Yeah. :: true
There won't be that many going though will there? To Plymouth. :: true
Oh I've got it here, evaluation. Oh right. :: true
Sorry there's a subgroup of the the national management initiative. Right. :: true
I know but erm if I don't see <unclear> I'm gonna crack. Ah. :: true
<pause> That's the results <unclear> about ten minutes ago, an hour ago. Yeah. :: true
She doesn't like it in that new place . No no. :: true
Who's that? My Aunty Peggy <gap reason=anonymization desc="last or full name">. :: true
Her daughter died of cancer and then a year later her  Oh right.  :: true
It would have shown? Aye. :: true
So I'm definitely not pregnant? Definitely not pregnant. <unclear>  :: true
Was it May you changed my pill wasn't it? Mhm. :: true
Trinordiol. Mhm. :: true
Now <unclear> see if we get whether I can get us fitted in. Mm right. :: true
You hold on to that. Right. :: true
Er and we've got your new phone number. Aye. :: true
You're not married yet? Yes. :: true
I got a prescription last week, Mhm. :: true
Aye, that's how, where I knew it wouldn't wanna go there. Ah. :: true
See when I'm walking I can actually hear something in the back of  Aye, creaking.  :: true
<unclear> Eh <pause> now this is strong stuff, never take it on an empty stomach. Never. :: true
<unclear> Eh <pause> now this is strong stuff, never take it on an empty stomach. Right? :: true
<shift new=whispering> Yeah. <shift> <pause> <unclear> Great. :: true
There's a good painkiller in those and there's the stuff to scatter the bruising as well. Good. :: true
so I've got to have my breakfast first? Aye, <unclear>. :: true
I need a a few more tablets of the yellow ones, the <unclear>. Oh right, right. :: true
Yes, oh aye, aye, just use it for the month Charlie and then, and then in the bucket, don't keep using it after that. Aha. :: true
Oh they're okay erm just one thing, erm I went to the dentist up <gap reason=anonymization desc="last or full name"> over there in <gap reason=anonymization desc="last or full name"> Street, and he made a mess of filling two teeth. Mhm. :: true
and only pay him further eight pound or whatever . Whatever, yeah. :: true
It's a lot of money. Aha. :: true
<unclear> When I went first he took one out there and he took it out clean, but this one here, in actual fact he gave me a stitch, and when the stitch wasn't in you could see the tooth protruding a bit. Oh right. :: true
And erm but when he took the stitch it's covered it up. Right. :: true
<unclear> I just wish it was all over, like now I had to last out until the thirty first of March, which I did do. Mhm. :: true
I'm forty, nearly forty five in January. Mhm. :: true
But now I'm just deciding I'll live off invalidity benefit for a wee while longer, leaving that in the hands of my my managing director and somebody else <unclear> and the money that's coming through from the Queen and whatever I'm just gonna live on invalidity benefit, I'm only drawing invalidity benefit, I'm not gonna get any more money than invalidity benefit. Okay. :: true
So with this going on we found our company would get on better if I had collateral so I wrote to this boy and asked him for a million and put it in a trust fund that I would get after his death, and we <unclear> that way so okay. Right? :: true
But erm, I <trunc> woul </trunc> what, erm, I also, the <gap reason=anonymization desc="last or full name"> Hotel, we bought that the same way, they were selling that back and making quite a fair bit of profit, investing the money in arable land. Mhm. :: true
So <unclear> but he thinks I've got away with it but the pus in my mouth right now Aye. :: true
But I'm <unclear> the rest of the cream. Mhm. :: true
I've got pain in my in my my jaw. Right. :: true
the Queen, <pause> Alexander <gap reason=anonymization desc="last or full name">, Sir Alexander <gap reason=anonymization desc="last or full name">, me, and and the piano player. Aha. :: true
I I forget his name, but it's all coming back, <unclear> little children in <unclear> well that's not bad isn't it, <unclear>. Not bad, not bad at all. :: true
No I I think it's just a really bad case of M E again . Yeah , yeah. :: true
weeks now, Yeah. :: true
dreadful. Yeah. :: true
That's right and I'm very depressed. Yeah. :: true
able to come here on my own. Yeah. :: true
Yeah but er it really has knocked me for six this time. Mhm. :: true
Erm I think it's probably that infection that I had er Yes. :: true
That thrush or whatever it was . Yeah. :: true
I think it worried her a bit. Yeah. :: true
but they're certainly <trunc> no </trunc> not so severe. Yeah. :: true
Do you find they respond better if you take Dihydrocodeine when they're there as well? Yes. :: true
Yes. Yeah. <unclear>  :: true
And maybe it's a very shallow down-slope but still on a down-slope. Mm. :: true
Two months, cos you seem stable . Two months.  :: true
They've got people who've been on it for years and years. Mm. :: true
So that's what we have to check from time to time. Mm. :: true
It's safe if you <trunc> st </trunc> stick to the speed limit. Usually. :: true
hormone cream? Yes. :: true
Well it's better but it's not right . Yeah. :: true
Find I'm down to using it twice a week now . Twice a week. :: true
used it this week. Alright, okay. :: true
to what it was. Oh good good. :: true
<unclear> I mean the advantage of that is you get <trunc> loc </trunc> You get the local benefits without generalized side-effects. Mm. :: true
But I'm actually using more and more of this cream, as I realize that er if you direct it towards the right part of the body in the right people, Mm. :: true
But it's important we keep <trunc> other </trunc> An eye on the other things, keep other things ticking over and things like the hormone cream and the lithium will be a help in that. Yeah. :: true
I mean it's it's always a <trunc> com </trunc> I mean the whole of life is a compromise but especially with this. Mm. :: true
But you can't overdo the mobility cos you get very very tired. Yeah. :: true
All else being equal, I would say October with the lithium level and then we're gonna have our review of lithium. Okay? :: true
There should be enough cream there now for four to six weeks on a twice weekly basis, but if you run out just give a ring in. Right. :: true
the current in that resistor. <u who=PS29T> Er the current in that resistor? :: true
<vocal desc=yawn> <pause> Erm I've gotta work out the current of the twelve volts first. Right. :: true
remember what that is? Erm resistance one <pause> plus resistance two divide by is it? :: true
and you were getting very close to it, Yeah. :: true
I, I have the feeling that it helps you to see it written down Yeah. :: true
I don't know, do you agree with that? Yeah. <u who=PS29S> :: true
Now are you certain about that? Yeah. :: true
Yeah. Good. :: true
the resistance the same the current goes up. Current goes up. :: true
It's a steady pressure trying to push that through, and we increase the resistance, we make more resistance Less current. :: true
So less current, <u who=PS29T> okay? :: true
if you have R ten times what it was in the <trunc> pres </trunc> the previous one, you'll now only get a tenth of the current out. Yeah. :: true
And erm the, what, how would you work out, think of a practical example, how would you work out the wattage erm <unclear> if you know the current? Erm the wattage if you know the current. :: true
Er let's say it's about two point four kilowatts. Mm. :: true
Er let's say it's about two point four kilowatts. Two point four kilowatts. :: true
mean you, you know these things, you know roughly what the wattage of a Yeah. :: true
And you know what the voltage is Yeah, two forty. :: true
Yeah, two forty. Two forty. :: true
So what's the tie up between those? Ten times two forty. :: true
T V is rated at <pause> a hundred and twenty watts, right? Mm. :: true
How big a fuse would you put in it? Okay? :: true
How would you think about that? Watts is equal to voltage times current. :: true
Watts is equal to voltage times current. Right. :: true
So you've <unclear> done is rewritten your equation, Yeah. :: true
So now you've got your equation. Yeah. :: true
So it's a half amp so what sized <trunc> fu </trunc> and they would probably give you erm, are you going to use a three amp, a five amp or a <trunc> fif </trunc> or a thirteen amp fuse? Yeah. :: true
So you're okay on that you, you've got from thinking oh I'm stuck on the other, I've nowhere to start, Yeah. :: true
must be the other way round, cos that's not right. Okay? :: true
So going back to the parallel, have you had any thoughts about it? Parallel :: true
Parallel Resistance in parallel. :: true
Have you got your text books, with you? <u who=PS29T> Yeah. <u who=PS29S> :: true
Cos I don't, I don't want to do much of, I know you <unclear> you want me to show you. Yeah. :: true
and a certain amount coming through this pipe. Yeah. :: true
Now would it be a smaller pipe, a bigger pipe or what? Bigger, than both of them. :: true
A bigger pipe has got <trunc> m </trunc> more resistance. Less resistance. <u who=PS29T> :: true
Less resistance. <u who=PS29T> Yeah. :: true
So again, everything comes back to quality and the C E D G being er essential <trunc> a </trunc> <trunc> a </trunc> and really er a building block for our future survival. <shift new=whispering> Okay <shift>. :: true
You might have to find your own chair actually. Oh right. :: true
can you just alter the third one to the thirty first of August ninety three? Which one? :: true
Which one? That one. :: true
Which one? That one you had your pen on. :: true
two please. Okay? :: true
Is it group four's erm plan? Group four. :: true
Do you want to make a note of that? Mm. :: true
Alistair <gap reason=anonymization desc="last or full name"> erm he's, he's made himself er he has made himself coordinator. And section engineer. :: true

Project engineer is Brian <gap reason=anonymization desc="last or full name">. Right. :: true
We haven't got some of our headings <unclear>. No. :: true
They've made that up I think. Mhm. :: true
They've made that up I think. Mm. :: true
That's against what, sorry? project remit. :: true
That's against what, sorry? Project remit. :: true
Our works bridges responsibility statement not completed. Yeah. :: true
No milestone dates quoted. No milestone. :: true

Right, Doctor I'm here for a er prescription for <sic resp=LONGMAN> Endoril L A </sic> <unclear>  Pink? :: true
Well I'll tell you <unclear> I, I, I was here last month and you know Doctor <gap reason=anonymization desc="last or full name">? Mhm.  :: true
that for three months. Yeah. :: true
She told me to come back to get my blood pressure checked again. Right.  :: true
<pause> You're not getting any funny fits from that at all, June? Er no. :: true
Er no. Nothing? :: true
Er no. Excellent. :: true
that's really only a problem in the winter time. Aye. :: true
You will be getting very cold weather Aha. :: true
Er the heating had broken down and I don't know whether it was <vocal desc=cough> because of the heating or because of the tablets or whatever but they're, they're alright now. Yes. :: true
It wasn't, it definitely wasn't the tablets because <trunc> i </trunc> if, if it had done that to you, it would have been all day. Aha. :: true
through the twenty four hours. Right. :: true
but I have actually seen all of the others. Right. :: true
Yeah you've met, have, am I the last? Erm so yes in a sense. :: true
What I did was prepare a supplementary form to the one that we had at the management team meeting Right. :: true
which lists the activities erm that we'd referred to before, on the original note Yeah. :: true
points. Yeah. :: true
Erm they'll probably all common off quite a bit. Yeah. :: true
And I'll look and see what ways we can collect the data erm to provide the er the intelligence if you like. Right. :: true
in which case we can disregard because it Yeah. :: true
So you'll know what the others have already said Okay. :: true
Well I wouldn't er I don't expect most things will <unclear> completely <unclear> but anyway we'll see. Yeah. <u who=PS21C> :: true
Erm number of part time centres, half day sessions, Yeah. :: true
And to be honest I wouldn't have argued if anyone had said whole day. Yeah. :: true
would include satellites <shift> like erm Northallerton. :: true
would include satellites <shift> like erm Askham Bryan :: true
In the north it would include Northallerton Grammar School and the Y C A P annexe. Yeah. :: true
that's actually an additional one that you've put in? Yeah. :: true
Yeah. Yeah. :: true
Number of sixth form students erm seen in the last year. Yeah? :: true
And the number of special schools' students and pupils, pupils seen, in years ten upwards. Yeah? :: true

Janet posted a letter for me last week to a friend who I worked with at Ipswich, she was one of the girls behind the counter and at the moment they, her and her husband, he, he, he, he was on the, he finished up but he started as a lad in the kitchen but he finished up as a chef on the dining cars and they married and er and they've got er two children erm they're married to and, and we kept, we've kept in touch with each other for sixty years Yes. :: true

So there'd be two clerks and two lads? No, one clerk :: true
So there'd be two signalmen, would there? Yes. :: true
Oh, now, is it really? Yes, yes. :: true
Right, well <unclear> did you, you went to school obviously locally? Yes. :: true
Where actually were you working? At <gap reason=anonymization desc=address>, I never moved from there. :: true
Casual wear, jeans and <shift new=laughing> open necked shirts <shift>, no caps, <trunc> no </trunc> Mm. :: true
<unclear> <trunc> du </trunc> during this during, before the war, it was trolley buses? Yes, yes. :: true
I, I couldn't be adamant about the date of those but er <trunc> c </trunc> the reason that motor buses came in is because it was too costly to extend trolley bus routes. With, with putting up new, new cables? :: true
At this time then after the war, how many vehicles were there running? Oh dear <vocal desc="clears throat"> I suppose seventy odd a day. :: true
It was its last run and it finished up at Priory Heath <pause> erm <vocal desc="clears throat"> was on the Gainsborough route. Why those routes? :: true
It, I think I had a good life there and I've got no regrets <pause> I think to be public transport is, is a good thing. Oh yes, right. :: true
Mm, it was the eleventh of October nineteen thirty nine. Mm. :: true
They always assumed that er, the disabled were two years behind the normal child so that er Mm. :: true
I was much more interested in football and cricket really, but erm, anyway, I left in the July of nineteen thirty nine when things were getting <pause> a bit erm dubious in the international sphere and erm Mm. :: true
<pause> Well erm <pause> erm <gap reason=anonymization desc="last or full name"> had a word with erm <gap reason=anonymization desc="last or full name"> who was about oh fourth in line in the erm education hierarchy in those days and erm <gap reason=anonymization desc="last or full name"> <vocal desc="clears throat"> then spoke to <gap reason=anonymization desc="last or full name"> who was the Chief Education Officer and er, I think they were a bit erm, bit apprehensive about employing a blind typist because erm it was something that they had never had any experience of <pause> but in the end they thought it was worth a try and er especially after supporting me at the College and erm also perhaps they had in mind that <vocal desc="clears throat"> many of the erm employees would be leaving if war broke out and erm, in fact by that time war had probably started Mm. :: true
You were the first blind person to be employed in the County Council?  In the County Council, yes. :: true
Mm, well there have been subsequent erm employees of course but Mm. :: true
I felt that it was a bit of a responsibility to erm, to justify the <shift new=laughing> employment <shift> of Yes. :: true
well <shift new=laughing> yes, yes <shift> I wondered whether I'd got it right you know, it sounded just a silly thing to ask and erm and I erm had to consider that <unclear> probably asked whether I had erm made a mistake in my shorthand <shift new=laughing> before, before <shift> I actually typed it but erm, anyway they seemed erm reasonably satisfied and everybody was very kindly and erm considerate and Mm. :: true
How did you travel? By, by bus mhm  :: true
confident really Mm. :: true
but anyway, erm people used to be very helpful and erm Mm mm. :: true
so I managed for a few weeks and then I went to lodge with my sister at Trimley Mm :: true
They had two or three different bus services and erm, the bus went past County Hall so that it was quite, Mm. :: true
In fact there were very few guide dogs at that time and erm I've never felt that erm it's, I mean maybe <pause> just my <pause> erm silliness really but I, I never wanted a dog lying about all day because once at the office I stayed put as it were until it was time to go home and I could have taken the dog I suppose during the lunch hour but I preferred that time to erm to reading Mm. :: true
and just relaxing and erm in any case as I say er guide dogs were few and far between at that time Mm mm. :: true
and I've never wanted one since because er luckily I've got erm my wife who, we get about together. Mm. :: true
Yes it's erm <pause> it was seventy five pounds a year at age nineteen Mm. :: true
and erm I actually received twenty seven and twopence a week, to start with it was paid weekly but subsequently erm we went on to the monthly erm payments and er but that's what I had and er <pause> I used to pay my sister fifteen shillings a week for, for lodgings. Mm. :: true
I think it was about forty four Mm. :: true
but of course erm as a sort of public to the er, er a gesture to the public erm but one stage during the war when things were getting a bit grim on the war front, it was decided that erm, we should work extra hours as erm, <unclear> to show that we were pulling our weight <shift new=laughing> <unclear> <shift>, so we used to, instead of starting at nine o'clock until erm half past five, and working on Saturdays as well of course, erm, we had to start at half past eight and finish at six and it was a bit of a fiasco really because nobody erm, you know, well the end of the half past five you were pretty well tired out so erm the rest of the time <pause> Mm. :: true
you were really kicking your heels and erm quite apart from which in the winter time the er conditions were pretty grim because they had the erm anti-splinter netting over the windows and erm big blinds which had to be drawn as soon as it was dusk because er, of course you weren't allowed to show a light and erm if that was <unclear> it became really thick Mm. :: true
mm, I don't think the cleaners were all that erm good at their job, I mean they, they were, er perhaps that's a bit unfair to them to say that because erm the collection of dust was erm <shift new=laughing> pretty dreadful <shift> Mm. :: true
with all the books and files around and er, it became, anybody with any chest troubles erm Mm. :: true
found it <trunc> v </trunc> very difficult cos erm atmosphere as I say was erm really dreadful Mm. :: true
it got very hot and erm stuffy and unpleasant Mm. :: true
so erm, and that went on for, I suppose till the end of the war when er, when we had a reduction in hours again, we went back to the normal nine till half past five. Mm. :: true
and erm <pause> I don't know what the idea really was, I think it was possibly so that erm, that people concerned with the Committee Meetings could erm sort themselves out and Mm. :: true
at least as far as I can remember. Mm mm. :: true
Oh, yes, yes , its erm, erm County Hall of course was the County Control Centre for erm air raid precautions Mm. :: true
erm, <trunc> ca </trunc> before I go on to that can I just erm tell you what erm, where we worked? Yes, certainly, sorry. :: true
Erm, the archway from St Helens is still there isn't it? Mm, yes. :: true
Now just on the left as you go under the archway there was a small door Mm. :: true
Erm, <trunc> interest </trunc> interestingly enough erm Cyril <gap reason=anonymization desc="last or full name"> was very friendly with er Tom's son Kenneth who was erm Planning Officer in some area now Sussex Mm, mm. :: true
I think but continuing down the corridor erm which was all the Education Department, you came to the typists' room right at the bottom of the corridor on the left Mm. :: true
and then erm turning right you went past the ladies' cloakroom and before you got to the door out into erm Grimwich Street Mm. :: true
there was a large room which was the Control Room and er in there they had erm four, three or four erm telephones which were manned constantly for twenty four hours Mm. :: true
We're talking about East Suffolk of course Yes. :: true
not erm the whole of Suffolk and erm the County Hall staff as a whole was divided into six shifts, erm and each shift was on duty for twenty four hours a day, for twenty four hours on Mm. :: true
and erm so that erm the shift that was on say Sunday, would erm erm be on again on the Saturday and so it erm, you know you got a different day Mm. :: true
each week and erm, the shift which was on duty say on Sunday would have Monday off, they were, they could erm go home on Monday Mm. :: true
They were always erm, making caustic comments about the entries in the, in the log book which the telephonists had to keep, erm, of the messages that came through Mm. :: true
<shift new=laughing> as you could imagine <shift> because erm they had all the whole building to erm to roam about in Yes. :: true
and er, I think the younger people quite enjoyed it but the older ones, of course, found it bit of a bind, er particularly after erm the sort of patriotic fervour Mm. :: true
wore off a bit, I mean there was erm, everybody was feeling very patriotic at the beginning of the war but after four or five years the erm novelty wore off Mm. :: true
Was there any financial incentive for Not <trunc> re </trunc> no, no, no, no.  :: true
But erm <pause> as far as financial incentive goes, erm <pause> it was about a year or so after erm I started there I think when er they introduced it, the erm war bonus, which was a supplement to normal salaries Mm. :: true
But erm there were one or two little hiccups of that sort where erm temporary staff were erm regarded as a bit er <unclear> second rate citizens <unclear> Mm. :: true
and erm, with all the erm younger men and some of the girls of course er, volunteered for the services Mm. :: true
er we had quite a number of married women coming in to er, to work as part of their war effort and erm, so that <pause> there was quite, there was quite erm <pause> quick turnover of staff at that time Mm. :: true
and erm <pause> to be fair to them, I don't think that erm some of them were particularly interested in, <shift new=laughing> in their work <shift> and er Mm. :: true
story. Yes. :: true
Very, very little really, erm we had contact with other Authorities of course, in the course, in erm er particularly in connection with evacuation, erm <pause> evacuation took up erm quite a lot of staff and, and time at that er particularly initially because erm Suffolk was in a peculiar position or at least the East Suffolk was, erm at the beginning of the war of course erm East Suffolk was an evacuation, er was erm a reception area Mm. :: true
and erm it was really remarkable because er, I mean presumably the Germans were told about it and erm kept <unclear> U-boats and <shift new=laughing> <unclear> <shift> and the <unclear> from shipping out the er Mm. :: true
and erm, then of course when they reached Felixstowe, everything was a bit chaotic because <trunc> th </trunc> they had to sleep on the floor in the schools down there Mm. :: true
Did evacuation just take place over two or three days or? Yes, mm mm, :: true
Yes, mm mm, Mm. :: true
but erm it had sorted itself out after, well more or less after a week or two a lot of the evacuees of course didn't stay very long, they went back home because erm <pause> I know mother had a, a little boy from erm Guildford when we lived at Debenham and er he went back after a while, the mother used to come down and visit him from time to time, they were very, came from very poor circumstances and the Mm. :: true
mother used to spend most of her time in the local when she did come and er Mm. :: true
in the end she took the children home with her, erm it was so different from what they'd been used to in those erm Mm. :: true
East, well in the East End particularly, Guildford was not much better Mm. :: true
but erm <pause> erm <pause> anyway <pause> the erm children were absorbed into the schools of some sort Mm. :: true
Then he went erm into the Navy for a short time and for some unknown reason he managed to get out of the Navy and came as Mr <gap reason=anonymization desc="last or full name"> 's Personal Assistant and erm one of his jobs was to erm get these <trunc> pe </trunc> children sorted out and I used to write no end of letters for him to erm places like erm Ilford and Wanstead and mainly the northern suburbs of London erm about certain children who had been attending central schools which were something, which were something that erm East Suffolk couldn't offer and erm trying to decide whether they ought to go to grammar school or one of the area schools as they <trunc> we </trunc> then were Mm. :: true
in Suffolk and erm most complicated situations we got into. Mm. :: true
The erm billeting actually was dealt with by a section connected with the er County Accountants Department Mm. :: true
which subsequently became the Treasurers <pause> and erm <pause> they used to erm collect the contributions from, from parents and there again I got involved because they were short of typists at one time Mm. :: true
And er oh you er it's social work you're interested in is it? Yes. :: true
Well, and what experience have you got? Not very much. :: true
bits to this would be erm I ran er a youth group in Ladywood which was er central Birmingham. Oh yes. <unclear> <u who=PS2MX> :: true
And er we did a couple of weeks erm teaching in schools and we helped run a erm a lunching club for old people. Oh yes. :: true
Well that I mean that <trunc> t </trunc> to get them in yeah that's the sort of thing we started with erm playing pool and er table tennis and that. Mm. :: true
you know a ten, fifteen minute discussion and stuff like that. On <pause> what sort of topics? <u who=PS2MX> :: true
On <pause> what sort of topics? <u who=PS2MX> On <trunc> r </trunc> on religious topics mostly. :: true
how did they <pause> sort of cope with their relationships or anything like that? No. :: true
the sort of thing that cropped up. Yeah. :: true
So I mean it doesn't, I mean, I mean the point about social work erm <pause> you know doing <pause> er some experience is I think so that you actually experience the erm <pause> sort of <trunc> so </trunc> the, the group dynamics of people who are in trouble and can't cope. Mm. :: true
If I were you I'd put the earphones in. Yes. :: true
If you put the earphones in can we just test first of all what's working? Yeah :: true

Peter, would you like to talk about language register in tabloids and broadsheets? Okay. :: true
But very often I think tabloid journalism is interesting in terms of language <unclear> because it's very punchy it's succinct because <trunc> i </trunc> <trunc> i </trunc> in some of our terms you might find people into a three minute reader and a thirty minute reader <pause> because in attention span and intellectual capacity are quite different <pause> but to actually condense something <pause> into meaningful short bursts, even if they are politically biased actually requires a certain amount of skill I would suspect <vocal desc="clears throat"> the clarity index which I can't find is the process that I mentioned the other night where you take <pause> erm some people call it the fog index <pause> a <pause> correct me if I'm wrong in my figures, but I think it's a piece of something like two hundred or three hundred words <pause> you count the number of <trunc> suc </trunc> erm colons and full stops or is it only full stops? Full stops. :: true
Full stops. Full stops. :: true
You then count the number of words of more than two syllables Mm. :: true
I mean like I saw a double-decker bus on the moon and that sort of stuff. Mm. :: true
It may be highly critical that the actual language will be completely different in the register. Yes. :: true
They will go for vocabulary which is highly charged with imagery and emotion. Mm. :: true
The others will chip in if they agree, but they will <pause> they are, they are wanting to set a missile to move, they're wanting to send a bullet, they are wanting to <trunc> s </trunc> to evoke emotion or anger or rage or frustration or political bias or to change attitudes now for example the interesting thing about the Princess Diana erm the headline on one of those tabloids which talks about exile <pause> is I suspect that they want to evoke the constitutional crisis which there was at the time of <pause> Edward. :: true
There was a special dispensation given to her to attend and in fact there were photographs at the time with the Queen with her. Yes. :: true
But, but, but the whole social and cultural <pause> revolution evolution change has led I think to <pause> whole different schisms in the press which perhaps may have existed in some of the very one might almost say near communist publication like the <unclear> Daily Worker. :: true
You'd be there six o'clock gone mate. Wonderful. :: true
You see one of the other interesting things is that there is a <pause> essentially a tradition in this country that the Royal Family do not sue newspapers Yes. :: true
There are various exceptions erm <pause> and there have been two or three in recent years, but it therefore meant that they were fair game for saying anything <pause> so they were fair game for a very sensational headline <pause> because there was very little chance of recrimination. Mm. :: true
Now the view er was that they were dignified and above taking action <pause> and also in the sense that the public was credited I think with more sense than to believe everything <pause> and that the public memory is relatively short and therefore if you start a court action and you then have coverage in the court action, you are merely making the thing <pause> worse <pause> erm sometimes the things that some people may have thought were highly actionable one day, become almost a joke and something of affection later on and you can, one of the classics maybe is about the Prince of Wales talking to his plants, now that <unclear> a national joke and he will make jokes about it in speeches Mm. :: true
and it's become <unclear> of the exchange of, of, of talk and of media erm <pause> but what else do we say about language register and vocabulary? Length of words :: true
Length of words Oh yes. :: true
I'm not sure, but I think when I studied this in college I think it was something like the average of <unclear> producers of vocabulary of less than two thousand words. Mm. :: true
Do you think it would be greater now? No, no actually no, not at all. :: true
I think that that is, is something that you know we looked at the <unclear> you know the Mirror that you know while thirty years ago they were doing short punchy stories and they maintained that, that there was actually <pause> A wider range of vocabulary  :: true
I mean I think you'll find that erm <pause> that there was an <trunc> amaz </trunc> you know I mean that, that while the language might have been simple <pause> it wasn't simplistic <pause> and, but the change in a <pause> in a way now is <unclear> around. Yeah. :: true
Do you know, do you know, am I being clear about that? Yeah  :: true
Do you know, do you know, am I being clear about that? Yes  :: true
One, the good, bad the <pause> the good, the bad and the unacceptable. Mhm. :: true
I would say that was in the Independent. Yeah. :: true
We will do what we can to er speed things and to catch up. Yes, Neil? :: true
Erm I see <unclear dur=8> so I'm not really <pause> <shift new=laughing> <unclear> <shift> will make sure that erm <pause> that we are kept in touch so that we are not so far down the track but they can't be reversed <unclear> committee as a whole  Absolutely.  :: true
I understand <trunc> an </trunc> and appreciate <trunc> wh </trunc> what you're saying and most grateful to you for that, I think <trunc> wha </trunc> what you're, Neil <gap reason=anonymization desc="last or full name"> is saying is is that with <unclear> we must make sure the time, that this main strategic planning he has to look at, this very important issue, allows sufficient time for mature consideration Yes. :: true
<trunc> I </trunc> <trunc> i </trunc> it may not be so, but it may be so Yes. :: true
I shall be getting a copy of this tape. Right. :: true
Er Chairman I'm <pause> perhaps I could also suggest that we change the word suggested erm <pause> because that <pause> <trunc> i </trunc> <trunc> i </trunc> it, perhaps you are looking for something slightly stronger erm er so it could just say in accordance with paragraphs two four to two nine or the points made in paragraph two point <unclear> Mm. :: true
She's very concerned and the present line partial though it be, represents a <pause> a blight situation on that, on the, on potential er occupants of that line <pause> and certainly erm <pause> I find myself more in <pause> in er agreement with Darcy's views than I do with the other two councillors of East Grinstead, that's not er not secret No, no no  :: true
I, I think Chairman that as, as we come out of the recession <trunc> an </trunc> and <pause> <trunc> th </trunc> that the overall erm level er quantity of development taking place increases, then we are almost bound to see perhaps more affordable housing erm in absolute terms, although I don't see any opportunity of there being a <pause> a major hiccup in proportional terms, so I, I, like you, I think I remain er pessimistic er regarding the, the, the overview, although we might see er a turning up of the er of the graph having been bumping along the bottom for a little time a little while. Yes, thank you Chairman. :: true
Basically erm I agree with what you say but that the County Council itself of course is <pause> a landowner of erm some quite attractive erm areas of land that could be used for below cost housing, but the problem in the past has been that they always had to sell erm at the <pause> market price. Precisely. :: true
<pause dur=20> I think that deals with the General Report and now we move into part No, no, no, no thirteen, thirteen <unclear> :: true
We approved that haven't we?  No, no. :: true

Er, I don't know what, and I think he, <trunc> we </trunc> he sent for that book, I sent for this <unclear> <pause> and its different issues <pause> which you can possibly used in erm <pause> P S D <trunc> se </trunc> er, etcetera <pause> and <pause> there's a number which I feel <pause> work across the years <pause> rather than just <pause> you know, sort of one year book <pause> for example there's a a unit there Terry and Mhm. :: true
that <pause> it's on changing schools, hope and fears Mm. :: true
what to do if erm <pause> you know, you're arriving at your first day or <pause> things like that. Mhm. :: true

Can I answer that question? Yes. :: true
So they can enter the secondary schools and they're selling it to these young kids that just don't know any better. Yeah. :: true
So I think if <pause> what we're doing just now, cos I'm part of Carlton Athletic as well, and what we're doing just now is trying to get into the secondary schools in the east end, and getting this message across to the kids not ee <pause> to buy these drugs. Yep. :: true
There actually is a drug-wise <pause> project Aha. :: true
they are, asked to respond to  Aha.  :: true
various situations and they  Aha.  :: true
do role play Mhm. :: true
I think what we should be looking at is <trunc> pu </trunc>, campaigning for de-criminalization of soft drugs, like cannabis Mm. :: true
And I also think that we should looking at harm reduction methods, in schools definitely <pause> not drug- wise. Yes. :: true
it there? why not? :: true
with er, there would be a certain amount of state control. Er, behind you. :: true
Have you come across anything <unclear> think ooh we could do with a look at that? Erm <pause> no. <vocal desc=laugh> :: true
Erm <pause> no. <vocal desc=laugh> Oh. :: true
Are you still working through past papers? Not really. :: true
been working on What? <u who=PS3SS> :: true
What? <u who=PS3SS> Graphs. <u who=PS3SR> :: true
Graphs. <u who=PS3SR> Graphs. :: true
<pause> <unclear> important thing about graphs. Erm. :: true
<pause> What would you get marks for? The axes. :: true
<pause> What would you get marks for? The <pause> points :: true
The <pause> points Which <trunc> parti </trunc> <unclear> particular points? :: true
Which <trunc> parti </trunc> <unclear> particular points? Points given for <pause> like co-ordinates. <u who=PS3SR> :: true
Erm let's <unclear>, if they say sketch a graph, Right. <u who=PS3SR> :: true
What would be the interesting parts of the shape? Where it crosses through the X and Y axes. :: true
Where it crosses through the X and Y axes. Okay, X and Y axes, anything else that might be an interesting point? <pause> :: true
So, sketching a graph is not the same as plotting one. Mm. :: true
Any idea what that graph would be? <pause> X squared. :: true
Erm, what would <pause> <unclear> not quite the right shape <unclear> <pause> what would that graph be? Y equals something <pause> plus X squared. :: true
And there might be, it would be something X squared, and there might be something X and er well there's definitely a constant Mm. :: true
So that's going to be minus something Mm. :: true
What about this one? Y equals X squared. :: true
It's gonna be about plus three, three plus. Mm. :: true
Where's the X, where's the Y? X squared. :: true
So it'll be something like <pause> X minus three X squared. Mm. :: true
So X equal three or X equal three. Yeah. :: true
Y would be six, <unclear>. <pause> Mhm. :: true
What's Y equal to, roughly? Just over six, six point :: true
Just over six, six point Six and a bit. :: true
What does it approximate to? Erm minus infinity. :: true
<pause> at minus a million. Erm :: true
What would that approximate to? A million plus six. :: true
Now, there's a Y equals X squared. Yeah. :: true
So around here, round this bit, <pause> there won't be any difference. Hmm. :: true
Erm <pause> people might say oh well we'll take it from minus five to plus five. Yeah. :: true
But you'd miss a lot of important points. Yeah. :: true
But you're still missing out a big, very important part of the graph, because for a lot of its range it actually, you know, looks something like well what would that look like? <unclear> <pause> Ten times. :: true
Roughly. A million times minus a million? :: true
A million times minus a million? Minus. <unclear> :: true
What's plus three times minus three? Three. :: true
What's plus three times plus three? <shift new=whispering> <unclear> <shift> Nine. :: true
<shift new=whispering> <unclear> <shift> Nine. Right. :: true
<pause> And, minus three times minus three? <pause> Minus nine. :: true
Minus nine. No. :: true
Minus three times minus three? <unclear> <u who=PS3SS> Oh nine. <u who=PS3SR> :: true
Oh nine. <u who=PS3SR> Right. :: true
And what is the sign of it though? Minus. :: true
It's the same <unclear> Right. :: true
So <trunc> wh </trunc> when X is very big well, say, when it's big compared to ten Yeah. :: true
this looks like Y equals minus X squared. <pause> Mm. :: true
It's where most people throw it away on the sketches, they just pick a tiny, tiny portion and look at that in great detail, say ah, look at that, wonderful. Mm. :: true
Tt, erm plotting graphs, you had one question didn't you where they asked a gradient? Yeah. :: true
And you measured it with a protractor, Mm. :: true
it was forty five degrees so you thought it was one, but the scale was two to one. Yeah. <unclear> :: true
Same scale on the X and Y. Erm what would be <pause> let's say someone gave you this <pause> find an approximation for the gradient <pause> erm Y equals X squared <pause> minus one. <vocal desc=laugh> X squared? :: true
you <trunc> d </trunc> you'd have to find Y. Okay. :: true
So Y is three squared minus one. Yeah okay. :: true
<unclear> be Y would equal eight. Yeah. :: true
<unclear> <pause> the opposite point. Right. :: true
<shift new=whispering> <unclear> <shift> It'd be about one <unclear>. About one. :: true
What, what would Y be? A million squared. :: true
What, what would Y be? Yeah. :: true
<pause dur=32> <unclear> I mean a hundred is probably big enough, twenty five might be <unclear> is more or less big enough. Mm. :: true
Er five, say we can have five here, you can have twenty five, <unclear> over here somewhere, Mhm. :: true
Lies over that way? Yeah. :: true
Well let me just say quickly we're being recorded there's <pause dur=2> there's someone er who's gotta er a project organisation by the Oxford University Press who's interested in our spoken word Right :: true
So will the tape last for the whole two hours? Yes, apparently. :: true
It's I've <pause dur=2> I was telling David outside that I've absolutely butchered it <pause dur=2> and I <pause dur=3> it's erm two thousand one hundred and sixty. Two thousand one hundred and sixty now? :: true
Two thousand one hundred and sixty now? Yeah. :: true
Yeah. Oh. :: true
Well as I've taped that I taped it at home Mm. :: true
but as I wrote this and you know put in the <trunc> acc </trunc> <trunc> th </trunc> the conflict, it came up to two thousand five hundred words and I taped it and timed it and I've been butchering it and cutting out all the really nice little sentences and the nice <unclear> sentences and I've got it down to two one sixty and now with that announcement on the end, <pause dur=3> as I've got it taped, it's fourteen minutes <shift new=laughing> fifty-nine seconds <shift> for a fifteen minute slot, so it's about as precise as you're gonna get it. Yes. :: true
Have you got anything Peter? Yes. :: true
Well <vocal desc=laugh> I mean you don't get paid for it or anything. Oh. :: true
like perhaps appeals to womens magazines more than the other stuff <pause dur=4> but I know that I mean it's not <pause dur=2> romantic in that way is it's not a romance <unclear> No. <unclear> :: true
There was one which you said Ernest Morris was born in 1950. Fifteen. :: true
Fifteen. Oh, fifteen. :: true
Oh, fifteen. Yes. :: true
I thought he said fifty as well. Oh no, fifteen. :: true
That <unclear> Castle was that the story by A J <unclear> Yeah. :: true
We receive up to a hundred and forty <unclear> week Oh. :: true
Chair, I I don't know, er er, last year, we were in a a similar position. Yes. :: true
The January meeting of this committee, we didn't know what the arrangements would be. Mm. :: true
<vocal desc="clears throat"> But certainly, some progress is being made towards the common funding formula. Mm. :: true
Paragraph twenty, provides details of the nineteen ninety-four, ninety-five budget target <unclear> policy. Yeah. :: true
The principles underlined, document, <event desc="shuffling of papers"> this project are er coarse, you would say, and for that reason we oppose it. Good. :: true
Commitments necessary for the maintenance of existing levels of service <unclear> Right. :: true
Did you wish to? Mm. :: true
Is it being proposed? No. <vocal desc=laugh> :: true
Mr Chairman, rapidly respond to Councillor Parker, you are the administration, this is your budget, Yeah. :: true
I would remind you that this is the budget for the policy. Yeah, true. :: true
The company haven't asked me to do it it's just er erm just a personal thing. Mhm. :: true
Erm right purpose of the discussions, I don't call them interviews er because it's a self employed position and er you know we're not offering quote a job unquote. Mhm. :: true
That that does us all the world of good. Yes. :: true
Right now I've got a bit of background Mhm. :: true
obviously erm I've <trunc> ju </trunc> all I've got down here is local newspaper advertising five years which would have been enough er Mhm. :: true
Er is that Lynda Jane? Yep. :: true
Yeah I'd read the brochure. Okay. :: true
Erm the folders are at the top Mhm. :: true
Remind me had John done advertising? Erm no. :: true
<pause> Now you have okay so you have to give erm er you're in an employed status at the moment Mhm yeah. :: true
so you have to give four weeks. Yep. :: true
Okay well you'll probably know erm that of course we can start people immediately if they were Mhm. :: true
basic of about eight and a half of something Mm. :: true
So you know it was up to you to sort of prove yourself from from there. Okay. :: true
there are advantages erm and quite honestly if erm er the way I put it is that salary company car and BUPA and all that sort of thing Mhm. :: true
Erm a no problem with er work permits and things like that? No. :: true
I've got dual nationality. Okay fine. :: true
Right well obviously that those last five years have been the er the important ones for us. Mhm. :: true
erm possibly that I would have emphasized er the fact that we don't do quote fact to fact selling Mhm. :: true
of advertising Mhm. :: true
we are really er I'm preaching the company policy and also something I know that er works Mhm. :: true
Right no qualifying in in in er I will tell you what the <unclear> erm er sort of policy on that or opinion on that is that if you have got er a closure on the phone. Mhm. :: true
Now you must have at some time or other in advertising closed the deal on the phone. Oh yeah mhm. :: true
Well that's that's what we mean by that. Right. :: true
I have I would say that most of the people who answer yes who have been in say for instance home improvements Mhm. :: true
Whereas we think Yeah. :: true
it's more towards the no. Yes. :: true
Because they cannot discuss the requirements on the phone. Mhm. :: true
When you say those you mean the golf cards? Yeah. :: true
That that type of idea. Right. :: true
Well er er erm the the whole point of about asking that sort of question is that er I in my own mind I know where I think Yeah. :: true
Er now we've got but we do have two products there of equal standing in terms of product er sorry of of erm salary potential Mhm. :: true
remuneration Yeah. :: true
Erm now John's on folders but there is another product range and that's the er This one. :: true
Well G A <trunc> be </trunc> based in Perth of course is er one of our major clients up here. Mhm. :: true
Er and once again they they they're all part of estates division and er you know they're as equally <trunc> valua </trunc> valuable to the er Yeah yeah. :: true
Erm I know some companies actually sell send the large ones out Yes. :: true
Yes they're not really meant to be sent out Yeah. :: true
I have to say though first of all especially if they have the larger version Mhm. :: true
Well thing is people are moving to an area they may be given some information by their company but Mhm. :: true
You'd still be in estates division Yeah. :: true
Erm but in the end it's all estates division anyway. Yeah. :: true
Er while I'm having a look through this er Richard er over there we have erm a selection of the product selection of the product which erm we discussed briefly on the phone. All right. :: true
There's a signature coming up is there? erm certainly the average cost of an ad if you took the most expensive and the least expensive across all of those products would come out somewhere in the region of six hundred pounds. Per ad? :: true
Per ad? Per ad. :: true
Per ad. But what size ad? :: true
If you look at a full page when they happen, they don't happen all that often on a schools portfolio which costs two thousand two hundred pounds, you'll see there's there's already three different prices Yeah. :: true
So you will go in you will never come out of a an advertiser with less commission than that. Right. :: true
Unless you have discounted it and you give two or three pounds away when you do that. Right. :: true
But in the main we are looking for er somewhere in the region of er hundred and eighty pounds per per per deal and we're looking for one of those a day average. Mhm. :: true
Our top people earn top money because A they're not satisfied with one deal a day. Mhm. :: true
An assignment being one complete One complete product yes. :: true
Possibly a solicitor now they're allowed to advertise. And a solicitor. :: true
The training course would certainly do that. Right. :: true
said Richard he said, I don't know how you do it in London he said, if they ever asked me to come down here he said I would die. Yeah. :: true
Richard erm if I now got to the stage of saying if if you had a choice, cos I have a luxury here of six companies er most recruiters just have one job for one company. Mm. :: true
What was I asking you Kieran? What day is it is it today. :: true
What day is it is it today. What day is it today. :: true
<event desc="speaking French"> What do you think my question means first of all, Richard? What date is it today. :: true
When's your birthday <trunc> Jo </trunc> Josephine? July. :: true
What July though? Fifth. :: true
Fifth. The fifth. :: true
Now children am I right in thinking that when Mrs <unclear> came in and took some lessons with you when I was on a course that she taught you how to count up to thirty? No. :: true
Okay, now let's have somebody else's birthday. Twenty eighth of December. :: true
What date is Richard's birthday? Twenty ninth of July. :: true
Twenty ninth of July. The twenty ninth of July good. :: true
What date is Louise's birthday? Eleventh of August. :: true
Eleventh of August. The eleventh of August. :: true
Er it's a business opportunity. Mhm. :: true
There are my notes and that it absolutely critical for us to know. All right yes. :: true
It's quite a different coloured pen. Yeah. :: true
Well first of all whether the the whole environment of selling advertising appeals. Mhm. :: true
But I've actually spoken to an even a a real Tyne and Wear Geordie accent Yes. :: true
I say I'm sorry I cannot understand a word you're saying. Yes. :: true
er so it wouldn't be any good for us. Mhm. :: true
I say well it's definitely the latter. The latter. <vocal desc=laugh> :: true
But there is a certain element of the former. Yes. :: true
Because in any self employed situation you're always going to get people who find something quote better Mhm. :: true
in their opinion and that's that and and they get it. Mhm. :: true
Well when you when you understand er when you get to understand the products I mean there's there all our six companies are represented over there er Maggie Right. :: true
And that is bring together the advertising to fund the product. Mhm. :: true
you see this this this one you brought in here Mhm. :: true
unless the local printer's very cleaver somehow and got that advertising to to sponsor er the booklet they've had to charge for it. Mhm. :: true
And I was disappointed I went and say, Hey Mm. :: true
by that time I'd been involved with <unclear>. Yes. :: true
It was costing them extra in postage Mhm. :: true
and they kept asking us to print more. Right. :: true
And that was expensive. Mhm. :: true
Schools universities and colleges they were a spin-off from the parents' choice charter. Right. :: true
And we bought the company last year that did that so that Right. :: true
So it's an ongoing process that the first medical <trunc> pra </trunc> or some medical practice booklets are just coming up for their second resale. Mhm right. :: true
Schools universities and colleges in er about a year's time the first resales. Mhm. :: true
So there is absolutely tons of work. Mhm. :: true
I was my own company er does management training and I won't touch the TECs Yeah. :: true
Is that the big company? Yes. :: true
Good fun? Yes. :: true
So the lads have er flown the coop have they? No no. :: true
And you're a grandmother too. Yes yeah. :: true
well I'm actually I'd like something cottagey if at all possible but erm I'm quite open minded at the moment erm I'm so new to the area I'm actually in Brookmans Park at the moment right :: true
yeah, you know quite hopeful so what I as I say what I'm really looking for is I've got a preference for older properties but you know try not to pin myself down to too much at the moment, I've got about a hundred and thirty to spend <unclear> so ideally I'd like a cottage old style but I do need three bedrooms O K, right :: true
erm ideally would like something in villages O K :: true
but something on the outskirts of the Garden City might be O K perhaps on the northern side right O K that's fine :: true
Right, well as I say I've got your details here so what I'll do is if you bear with me I'll go and a have a look through the drawers and see what we've got available. Okay? :: true
The strengths that these people show are an ability to command respect, <pause> and to inspire enthusiasm <pause dur=15>. Inspire, sorry? :: true

Erm, <trunc> in </trunc>, sorry, enthusiasm. Inspire enthusiasm. :: true

Yes, well the good news is, that there's actually something called waiver of premium on the plan, which looks after exactly the, looks after exactly that case. Yes. :: true
Some people will actually say, if I could add something to the plan that would cost you just a little bit more, which means that if you're off work through illness, the company, Abbey will pay the premiums for you, would you be prepared to pay a bit more. No. :: true
Are you happy with, with the idea and the way I put it across, yes? Mhm, yes, :: true

So Gerald to John, what are we talking about? Erm, death benefit. :: true
Erm, death benefit. Death benefit, right. :: true
O K then, O K then John, er, looking at your erm, at your fact file, we see here that we've actually got erm, twice the amount of your salary erm, for life cover, which your company which your company actually offers, offers you. O K? :: true
O K? Yes. <vocal desc="clears throat"> :: true

Oh, erm, terminal illness. Terminal illness, right. :: true
Well, how would you feel if I was to tell you that within the policy it was possible that the sum could be paid, it might even be paid up before death. yes, like what? :: true
Can I ask, address another table, <trunc> N </trunc>, yes, anybody, yes. :: true
About? Erm, unit linking. :: true
Erm, unit linking. Unit linking. :: true
You know, do you know anything about unit trusts? Not really, no :: true
What was it before? Seven 0 five :: true
Oh, is that all? Yeah. :: true
Apparently the individual costs of the lines are staggering and they reckon that the cost of the calls does not outweigh it but what I think <unclear> is certainly outweighed is the cost of all our time trying to get through on these lines Tie lines? :: true
Tie lines? Yeah :: true
Yeah Oh well :: true
I think it's worth identifying cos it might sort of alleviate this sort of problem Mhm :: true
Well we need <trunc> t </trunc> we need <trunc> t </trunc> we we need to establish ah I hope we do it. Right :: true
Why don't you and I talk about it separately then Yeah alright :: true
Why don't you and I talk about it separately then Next time we're in the office :: true
For instance that chap you gave those tickets to to Munich Yeah :: true
You know to encourage him <trunc> t </trunc> well why not just send them a voucher for seventy <trunc> f </trunc> seventy five pounds to go towards an <gap reason=anonymization desc="last or full name"> ticket next time they book? No no no <unclear> so :: true
You know to encourage him <trunc> t </trunc> well why not just send them a voucher for seventy <trunc> f </trunc> seventy five pounds to go towards an <gap reason=anonymization desc="last or full name"> ticket next time they book? Or twenty five pound :: true
Well a voucher's cash no a voucher to use :: true
no a voucher to use against a flight :: true
What're you trying to achieve? to stop giving away free seats when these people are prepared to pay :: true

I'm not bothered about paying for them Okay :: true
She's not really enthusiastic about it and of course no doubt we're getting problems again, stuff going missing, stuff like that, whatever Yeah :: true
to delegate yeah well I mean that's this is why I think I should bring forward a supervisors course for <gap reason=anonymization desc="last or full name">, for <gap reason=anonymization desc="last or full name">, for <gap reason=anonymization desc="last or full name">, for <gap reason=anonymization desc="last or full name"> Yeah :: true
And get it done as soon as possible Yep :: true
Yeah she's started to go off sick a lot but she seemed a lot better when she came back after Christmas Yeah :: true
So you you want my name printed there? Yes please :: true
Yes please Right. :: true
<pause> And erm <pause> all the different erm fabrics Mm. :: true
So erm in addition to these erm fabrics here, right at the back of the book Mhm. :: true
bit more fancy that the the standard ones. Yeah. :: true
So what we're looking for is one that will ern go erm Yes. :: true
to that angle. Right :: true
However I think erm <trunc> y </trunc> you're one the right track erm picking white out Mm. :: true
It is going to reflect the Yes. :: true
I've got erm I'll show the type of thing I've got. Yes. :: true
It's not it's not actually in here but <pause> I've got erm perhaps that kind of colour Mm. :: true
Yes but <trunc> a </trunc> similar to that but a little bit darker. Mm. :: true
quite warm Yeah. :: true
<unclear> we've got an old <u who=PS4GF> Yeah. :: true
in the Summer which stops the heat Yeah. :: true
And er <trunc> th </trunc> <trunc> th </trunc> they looked very nice. Yeah. :: true
To keep the rain out. <u who=PS4GE> Yeah, :: true
Right I'll leave you to Okay. :: true
<unclear> I haven't had time to get it up on the machine to change again quickly but I've had a quick look at the situation with regard to the five per cent increase. Yeah. :: true
So the saving that we were going to make them, by reducing five per cent but increasing the lancer machine bearings and bumping this standard cost one up to well as it turned out, seventeen per cent margin. Yeah? :: true
The tools <unclear> I wanted to get rid of. Okay. :: true
It's changed really now because of the fact we pulled <unclear> Yeah. :: true
need to re-look at how we Because he's mentioned straight away, as soon as he was in the mire Right. :: true
Basically what if we do increase to that price. Yeah. :: true
The two arrow machines use it and there's a hundred and two hundred and nine machines altogether Yeah. :: true
Yes that's how much extra it'll cost him. Yeah. :: true
Well this is this is what the point Yeah. :: true
I want to try and get it done, bearing in mind Elaine's going to have to have the baby on Friday if she hasn't had it before. Yeah. :: true
So will more than likely be off next week, but I do want to try and get something done with this and some of the other accounts, I want to try and get them out the way before I Right. :: true
It's just those two that'll have gone down by five per cent which are the sabre machine bearings. Right. :: true
It's just those two that'll have gone down by five per cent which are the sabre machine bearings. Okay? :: true
on the sabre range, the lancers and the arrows, Yeah. :: true
Still offering them a three thousand pound saving. Yeah. :: true
But helping our spread if you know what I mean. Yeah? :: true
This is based on full full year isn't it. Yeah. :: true
Erm one of the things that er <pause> would be nice to end up with is a price on the books which is the higher price. Yeah. :: true
So that the price we want to end up with on the books is is Mhm. :: true
that one, that one, that one Yeah. :: true
Er well selected for their standards that we think is the only way they could do it. Yeah. :: true
So what's the advantage of of our product over theirs. Nothing really. :: true
Right well that's something that's something that you've got to you've got to differentiate. Mm. :: true
Ours are noise tested correct? Yeah. :: true
Is there anything else like that which erm er which we do that they may not do. Not really. :: true
I've a feeling <unclear> B E T N. B E T N. :: true
Yeah, it's the <gap reason=anonymization desc="last or full name"> one, I'm not so sure what they would supply you see. Possibly nylon. :: true
And er er and and that that these have er substantial advantages for them and and don't know but but there's got to be an element of doubt. Yeah yeah. :: true

Not only is development of the new company's initial machine tied directly to Mr. Cray, so is its balance sheet.

But it is Mr. Lane, as movie director, producer and writer, who has been obsessed with refitting Chaplin's Little Tramp in a contemporary way. In 1976, as a film student at the Purchase campus of the State University of New York, Mr. Lane shot "A Place in Time," a 36-minute black-and-white film about a sketch artist, a man of the streets. Now, 13 years later, Mr. Lane has revived his Artist in a full-length movie called "Sidewalk Stories," a poignant piece of work about a modern-day tramp. Of course, if the film contained dialogue, Mr. Lane's Artist would be called a homeless person. So would the Little Tramp, for that matter.  :: false
I say " dialogue " because "Sidewalk Stories " isn't really silent at all. Composer Marc Marder, a college friend of Mr. Lane's who earns his living playing the double bass in classical music ensembles, has prepared an exciting, eclectic score that tells you what the characters are thinking and feeling far more precisely than intertitles, or even words, would.  :: false
The Artist has his routine. He spends his days sketching passers-by, or trying to. At night he returns to the condemned building he calls home. His life, including his skirmishes with a competing sketch artist, seems carefree. He is his own man.  :: false
To further load the stakes, Mr. Lane dreamed up a highly improbable romance for the Artist, with a young woman who owns her own children's shop and who lives in an expensive high-rise apartment building. This story line might resonate more strongly if Mr. Lane had as strong a presence in front of the camera as he does behind it.  :: false
Mr. Wilder did introduce such legislation 17 years ago, but he did so at the request of a constituent, a common legislative technique used by lawmakers.

But maintaining U.S. influence will be difficult in the face of Japanese dominance in the region. Japan not only outstrips the U.S. in investment flows but also outranks it in trade with most Southeast Asian countries ( although the U.S. remains the leading trade partner for all of Asia ). Moreover, the Japanese government, now the world's largest aid donor, is pumping far more assistance into the region than the U.S. is. While U.S. officials voice optimism about Japan's enlarged role in Asia, they also convey an undertone of caution. "There's an understanding on the part of the U.S. that Japan has to expand its functions " in Asia, says J. Michael Farren, undersecretary of commerce for trade. " they approach it with a benevolent, altruistic attitude, there will be a net gain for everyone."  :: false

And executives at stations in such major markets as Washington ; Providence, R.I. ; Cleveland ; Raleigh, N.C. ; Minneapolis, and Louisville, Ky., say they may very well not renew "Cosby."

That explains why the number of these wines is expanding so rapidly. But consumers who buy at this level are also more knowledgeable than they were a few years ago. "They won't buy if the quality is not there," said Cedric Martin of Martin Wine Cellar in New Orleans. " if they feel the wine is overpriced and they can get something equally good for less." Mr. Martin has increased prices on some wines ( like Grgich Hills Chardonnay, now $ 32 ) just to slow down movement, but he is beginning to see some resistance to high-priced red Burgundies and Cabernets and Chardonnays in the $ 30 to $ 40 range.  :: false

The program-trading issue is heating up on Capitol Hill as it is on Wall Street, and several legislators want to grant the SEC the power to shut off the programs when trading becomes too volatile.

Still, some market analysts say the current 3.3 % reading isn't as troublesome as it might have been in years past. "It's not a very meaningful indicator currently because corporations are not behaving in a traditional manner," says James H. Coxon, head of stock investments for Cigna Corp., the Philadelphia-based insurer.  :: false
In particular, Mr. Coxon says, businesses are paying out a smaller percentage of their profits and cash flow in the form of dividends than they have historically.

"It has not been disruptive in the markets here," Mr. Maughan said. "The real difference seems to be that the cash market here... is big enough and liquid enough that the futures market isn't having the same impact it does in America."  :: false
He also is a consensus manager, insiders say. The decision to make the bid for Nekoosa, for example, was made only after all six members of Georgia-Pacific's management committee signed onto the deal -- even though Mr. Hahn knew he wanted to go after the company early on, says Mr. Correll. Associates say Mr. Hahn picked up that careful approach to management as president of Virginia Polytechnic Institute. Assuming that post at the age of 35, he managed by consensus, as is the rule in universities, says Warren H. Strother, a university official who is researching a book on Mr. Hahn. But he also showed a willingness to take a strong stand. In 1970, Mr. Hahn called in state police to arrest student protesters who were occupying a university building.  :: false
The framers hardly discussed the appropriations clause at the Constitutional Convention of 1787, according to Madison's notes. To the extent they did, their concern was to ensure fiscal accountability. Moreover, the framers believed that the nation needed a unitary executive with the independence and resources to perform the executive functions that the Confederation Congress had performed poorly under the Articles of Confederation. It would contradict that objective if the appropriations clause ( technically a limitation on legislative power ) could be read as placing the president on Congress's short leash, making the executive consist of the president and every member of Congress.  :: false
President Bush should veto appropriations acts that contain these kinds of unconstitutional conditions on the president's ability to discharge his duties and exercise his prerogatives. If President Bush fails to do so in his first year, he will invite Congress, for the remainder of his presidency, to rewrite Article II of the Constitution to suit its purposes. What becomes custom in the Bush administration will only become more difficult for future presidents, including Democrats, to undo.  :: false
If President Bush loses at the court, it might be disappointing, as Morrison v. Olson was for the Reagan administration. But the presidency would be no worse off than it is now.

If President Bush loses at the court, it might be disappointing, as Morrison v. Olson was for the Reagan administration. But the presidency would be no worse off than it is now. Moreover, the electorate would have received a valuable civics lesson in how the separation of powers works in practice.  :: false
As it stands now, Congress presumes after the Reagan administration that the White House will take unconstitutional provisions in appropriations bills lying down. President Bush should set things straight. If he does not, he will help realize Madison's fear in The Federalist No. 48 of a legislature " extending the sphere of its activity and drawing all powers into its impetuous vortex."  :: false
Department economists don't expect 1989 to be as good a year as 1988 was. Indeed, net cash income is likely to fall this year as farm expenses rise and government payments to farmers decline. At the same time, an increase of land under cultivation after the drought has boosted production of corn, soybeans and other commodities, causing a fall in prices that has been only partly cushioned by heavy grain buying by the Soviets.  :: false
The Herald joins the Baltimore News-American, which folded, and the Boston Herald-American, which was sold, as cornerstones of the old Hearst newspaper empire abandoned by the company in the 1980s. Many felt Hearst kept the paper alive as long as it did, if marginally, because of its place in family history. Its fanciful offices were designed by architect Julia Morgan, who built the Hearst castle at San Simeon. William Randolph Hearst had kept an apartment in the Spanish Renaissance-style building.  :: false

Short of a total ban, some anti-programmers have proposed several middle-ground reforms, which they say would take away certain advantages program traders currently enjoy in the marketplace that other investors don't.  :: false
In point of fact, volatility as measured by the annualized standard deviation of daily stock price movements has frequently been much higher than it is today. Periods before the advent of futures or program trading were often more volatile, usually when fundamental market conditions were undergoing change ( 1973-75, 1937-40, and 1928-33 for example ). It is interesting to see the fundamental stock pickers scream "foul " on program trading when the markets decline, while hailing the great values still abounding as the markets rise. Could rising volatility possibly be related to uncertainty about the economics of stocks, instead of the evil deeds of program-trading goblins ?  :: false
Mr. Egnuss's dislike of program trading is echoed by many small investors interviewed by Wall Street Journal reporters across the country. But like Mr. Egnuss, few expect it to be halted entirely, and a surprising number doubt it should be.  :: false
"I think program trading is basically unfair to the individual investor," says Leo Fields, a Dallas investor. He notes that program traders have a commission cost advantage because of the quantity of their trades, that they have a smaller margin requirement than individual investors do and that they often can figure out earlier where the market is heading.  :: false
" as the 1980s bull market transformed the U.S. securities business, so too will the more difficult environment of the 1990s," says Christopher T. Mahoney, a Moody's vice president.

Indexing -- Many investors, mainly institutions, follow an investment strategy of buying and holding a mix of stocks to match the performance of a broad stock-market barometer such as the S&P 500. Many institutional index funds are active program traders, swapping their stocks for futures when profitable to do so.  :: false
Many investors wrote asking the SEC to require insiders to report their purchases and sales immediately, not a month later. But Mr. Lane said that while the SEC regulates who files, the law tells them when to do so. Investors who want to change the required timing should write their representatives in Congress, he added. The SEC would likely be amenable to legislation that required insiders to file transactions on a more timely basis, he said.  :: false

No wonder. We were coming down straight into their canal. See, the other rule of thumb about ballooning is that you can't steer. And neither can your pilot. You can go only up or down ( by heating the balloon's air with a propane burner, which does make the top of your head feel hot ) and ride the air currents. Which makes the chase car necessary. Most balloonists seldom go higher than2,000 feet and most average a leisurely 5-10 miles an hour. When the balloon is cruising along at a steady altitude there is little sense of motion. Only when one is ascending -- or in our case descending a tad trop rapidement -- does one feel, well, airborne in a picnic basket.  :: false
The FBI initially showed little interest, and he had the impression other federal security agencies were tangled up in legal red tape. The CIA told him it does not do domestic counterespionage. One learns a lot from this book, or seems to, about crippling federal bureaucracy. "Seems to " because it's possible that the CIA and the National Security Agency were more interested than they let on to Mr. Stoll.  :: false
I was pleased to note that your Oct. 23 Centennial Journal item recognized the money-fund concept as one of the significant events of the past century. Actually, about two years ago, the Journal listed the creation of the money fund as one of the 10 most significant events in the world of finance in the 20th century. But the Reserve Fund, America's first money fund, was not named, nor were the creators of the money-fund concept, Harry Brown and myself. We innovated telephone redemptions, daily dividends, total elimination of share certificates and the constant $ 1 pershare pricing, all of which were painfully thought out and not the result of some inadvertence on the part of the SEC.  :: false
The judge says he can't discuss in detail how he will defend himself at his trial, although he contends that if he were as corrupt as state prosecutors believe, he would be far wealthier than he is.

"You can't say it's a " tsunami " tidal wave ), but we're making some headway," says Fannie Mae's chairman, David O. Maxwell, who visits Tokyo at least once a year to explain and drum up investor interest in mortgage securities. "Interest is a great deal higher than it was a year ago." The steady growth of the mortgage securities market in the U.S. has even triggered talk of building up a similar market here.  :: false
These securities are attractive to Japanese investors for three reasons. First, they are safe. While they aren't backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, as Treasury bonds are, it is widely assumed that the government would support them if necessary. ( U.S. Treasury bonds are still the dollar-denominated investment of choice for long-term Japanese investors ). Second, they are liquid. The secondary market in federally backed mortgage securities now exceeds $ 900 billion, or nearly half of the $ 2.2 trillion in U.S. residential mortgages issued. Third, they offer high yields. At the moment, some offer as much as 1.6 to 1.8 percentage points over Treasury securities of similar maturities.  :: false
In addition, further packaging of mortgage-backed securities, such as Blackstone's fund, have reduced the effects of prepayment risk and automatically reinvest monthly payments so institutions don't have to. Freddie Mac for years has offered a so-called participation certificate that guarantees it won't be prepaid for a set number of years and offers semiannual payments.  :: false
Talks between the two sides could unravel, of course, as they have more than once since Sony announced its plans to hire Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters. But both sides appear to be more willing now to meet each other's terms to resolve the issue. And although Warner has said it wanted the producers to fulfill the terms of their contract, the producers said in sworn court declarations that they didn't believe the relationship could be repaired after the acrimony of the legal battle.  :: false

Mr. Moon planned to convert millions of Americans to his unique brand of Christianity -- in which he plays the role of Old Testament-style temporal, political messiah -- and then to make the U.S. part of a unified international theocracy. His original strategy ( in itself a brilliant innovation for spreading a religion ) was to create new economic enterprises each time he wanted to extend and fund his various religious missions. Tax-exempt airport and street-corner solicitations were intended only to provide start-up funds. More stable industries were to build an economically viable infrastructure for the Moon movement in North America, as they had in Japan and South Korea. Then he would move his movement to Europe.  :: false
An 11-week dispute involving Australia's1,640 domestic pilots has slashed airline earnings and crippled much of the continent's tourist industry. "The only people who are flying are those who have to," said Frank Moore, chairman of the Australian Tourist Industry Association. He added : " is a travel agent going to sell a holiday when he can not guarantee a return flight ? " Transport giant TNT, which owns half of one of the country's two major domestic carriers, said the cost of the dispute had been heavy, cutting TNT's profits 70 % to $ 12 million in the three months to Sept. 30.  :: false

Finally, I think it important to point out the extraordinarily high visibility of non-violent civil disobedience in these days of intensive media coverage. Give television a chance to cover live any breaking of the law, and no second invitation will be required. This brings into question the motives of those who lead civil disobedience demonstrations. Do they want the spotlight for themselves or for their cause ? Here is a good rule of thumb : If the movement produced the leader, the chance that he is sincere is much greater than if the leader produced the movement. In either case, ask yourself whether you have become better informed on the issues under protest by watching the act of civil disobedience. If you have not, it is probable that a thorough airing of the dispute by calm and rational debate would have been the better course.  :: false
J. Nicholas Hahn, Cotton Inc.'s president and chief executive, was an outspoken critic of WPP Group's acquisition of Ogilvy Group earlier this year. During the takeover, Mr. Hahn said he would put his account up for review if WPP's bid were successful, but he didn't.  :: false

But there were hitches, not the least of which was that, Mr. Wathen says, he proceeded almost blindly in doing the $ 95 million acquisition, which was completed in January 1988. "We weren't allowed to do any due diligence because of competitive reasons. If we had, it might have scared us off," he says.  :: false
We hear that HUD Secretary Jack Kemp is toying with going along with some of the Cranston-Mitchell proposals. That sounds like a formula for ensuring that he gets dragged into the next HUD tar pit. A group of 27 Senators has written Mr. Kemp urging him to reject Cranston-Mitchell and focus on programs that empower the poor rather than create vast new government obligations. But even if he agrees, Mr. Kemp doesn't write the nation's housing law -- Congress does. And the majority of Members cynically view the current discrediting of HUD as mainly a chance to shove through their own slate of projects.  :: false
"Most people -- whether in Toledo, Tucson or Topeka -- haven't got a clue who we are," says Guy L. Smith, Philip Morris's vice president of corporate affairs. " they think well of the company through our support of the Bill of Rights, it follows they'll think well of our products." Mr. Smith says the Bill of Rights commercial, which trumpets the themes of liberty and freedom of expression, isn't designed to have any special appeal for smokers. Although Philip Morris typically tries to defend the rights of smokers with free-choice arguments, "this has nothing to do with cigarettes, nor will it ever," the spokesman says.  :: false
That nets out to about $ 17 a share for the company on a private market basis. But Santa Fe, currently trading at 18 7\, isn't likely to realize private market values by selling assets, because the tax against it would be onerous.

By concentrating all their resources on the pay raise, Wright and Tower, the networks actually overlooked some major stories that showed the flaws and shortcomings of the institution.... An imaginative producer could easily have created a fast-moving and interesting piece about how Congress really works -- and why voters in, say, West Virginia got a federally funded university project and building while voters in Arkansas did not. But nobody did such a piece, reflecting a contemporary axiom : the more a scandal has to do with a congressman's duties as a congressman, the less likely it is to catch the fancy of a network.  :: false
What Ms. Pfeiffer had going for her besides determination -- Ms. Stevens recalled that the actress was up one night until 3 a.m. practicing "My Funny Valentine " -- was an airy alto, a nice breathy quality and intelligence. " we first started working it was a matter of finding a language we both understood," Ms. Stevens said. "I couldn't talk with her as I would with someone who had a lot of vocal training."  :: false
So what Ms. Stevens talked about was the importance of saying the words at the front of the mouth with the lips and the teeth. She urged Ms. Pfeiffer to get the feeling of a smile in her throat and to put a smile on her face to give the pitch and the sound a lift. She kept harping on the importance of overdoing the consonants and percussive endings like "T " and "K." She talked about using language as a tool, about flirting with the lyrics. And please, Michelle, when you sing the line in "Makin' Whoopee," about another sunny, funny honeymoon, don't say "funn-ih," the way Dylan would. Say "funn-eeee." Put the clean vowel ending on it. And Michelle, must you continue to smoke two packs of cigarettes a day ?  :: false
All 50 states require that small children be strapped into safety seats in cars. On planes, FAA rules dictate that children two years old and over have their own tickets and be strapped into regular seats, just as adults are. Babies under two may sit on laps and fly for free. But it is almost impossible to keep hold of a baby during an air crash, or even in severe turbulence.  :: false
First, addressing the Oct. 13 market break, this was certainly more of a technical gyration and a local jungle exercise, than an investor reaction to the day's political events in Washington. Look not to the managers of taxable investment funds as the source of selling late that afternoon, but rather to several of the usual suspects ( " " banks and institutions ) geared up with imperfect trading programs that accelerate market deterioration, once begun. The catalyst for this decline was, indeed, the breakdown of the United Airlines transaction and its resultant pre-margin call liquidation of various holdings by arbitragers and other traders. I can assure Mr. Wanniski that the market is not as politically motivated as he is.  :: false
Some analysts have said Courtaulds' moves could boost the company's value by 5 % to 10 %, because the two entities separately will carry a higher price earnings multiple than they did combined. In addition, Courtaulds said the moves are logical because they will allow both the chemicals and textile businesses to focus more closely on core activities.  :: false
But raising stock-index futures margins could make the stock market even more volatile, futures traders contend. Higher margins would price many professional speculators -- whose trades help futures markets function smoothly -- out of business. If these speculators can't afford to trade as actively as before, stock-index futures prices, and therefore stock prices, may have to fall further than they might otherwise to attract buyers.  :: false
Warner and Mr. Azoff declined comment, as did MCA, where Mr. Azoff had also been discussing such a venture. But record industry executives familiar with the talks said Mr. Azoff and Warner came to an agreement yesterday to form a 50-50 joint-venture company funded by Warner and run by Mr. Azoff. Among other things, they said, Mr. Azoff would develop musical acts for a new record label.  :: false
The agreement is said to be similar to Warner's 50-50 partnership with record and movie producer David Geffen, whose films and records are distributed by the Warner Bros. studio and the Warner records unit. Although Mr. Azoff won't produce films at first, it is possible that he could do so later, the sources said.  :: false

If Mr. Gates had been allowed to say these things, we would now be hearing about "discord " and "disarray " on foreign policy. Dark hints would be raised that parts of the administration hope Mr. Gorbachev would fail, just as they were when Vice President Quayle voiced similar sentiments. It's somehow OK for Secretary Baker himself, however, to say all the same things. In fact, he did ; the quotes above are from Mr. Baker's speech of two weeks ago.  :: false

Japan normally depends heavily on the Highland Valley and Cananea mines as well as the Bougainville mine in Papua New Guinea. Recently, Japan has been buying copper elsewhere.

All independent media activity is now illegal, which perhaps is not surprising, but so is the manufacture of perfume, cosmetics, household chemicals and sand candles.

The closeness of Soviet perestroika to the fascist social blueprint of Mussolini was evident when Mr. Gorbachev presented his economic vision to the Soviet Congress. In doing so, he neither rejected a socialist planned economy nor embraced the free market. Instead, he proposed a "law-governed economy," in which there would be a "clear-cut division between state direction of the economy and economic management." The latter would be undertaken by "enterprises, joint stock companies and cooperatives." These would not function independently, but would act together to form ", unions and associations " to tackle problems and coordinate their activities.  :: false
Mr. Gorbachev is in a much stronger position to pursue the corporatist ideal than was Mussolini, who was never able to influence business giants such as Pirelli and Fiat. The Soviet Communist Party has the power to shape corporate development and mold it into a body dependent upon it.  :: false
The U.S. market, too, is dominated by a giant, International Business Machines Corp. But early on, IBM offered its basic design to anybody wanting to copy it. Dozens of small companies did, swiftly establishing a standard operating system. That spurs competition and growth, allows users to change and mix brands easily, and increases software firms' incentive to write packages because they can be sold to users of virtually any computer.  :: false
In Japan, "software is four to five years behind the U.S. because hardware is four to five years behind, because NEC is enjoying a monopoly," complains Kazuhiko Nishi, the president of Ascii Corp., one of Japan's leading PC-magazine publishing and software companies. "There are no price wars, no competition." An NEC spokeswoman responds that prices are higher in Japan because customers put a greater emphasis on quality and service than they do in the U.S. She adds that some technological advances trail those in the U.S. because the Japanese still import basic operating systems from American companies.  :: false
But the Americans are also to blame. They long made little effort here. IBM, though long a leader in the Japanese mainframe business, didn't introduce its first PC in Japan until five years after NEC did, and that wasn't compatible even with the U.S. IBM standard. Apple didn't introduce a kanji machine -- one that handles the Chinese characters of written Japanese -- until three years after entering the market. Critics also say American companies charge too much. Japan's FTC says it is investigating Apple for allegedly discouraging retailers from discounting.  :: false

"Due to the earthquake in San Francisco, Nissan is donating its commercial air time to broadcast American Red Cross Emergency Relief messages. Please contribute what you can," the ad said.

Within two hours, viewers pledged over $400,000, according to a Red Cross executive.  :: false
Toyota's upscale Lexus division, a sponsor of the World Series, also put in a plug for Red Cross donations in a World Series game it sponsored. "The World Series is brought to you by Lexus, who urges you to help relieve the suffering caused by the recent earthquake...," the game announcer said. And New York Life made a plea for Red Cross donations in newspaper ads in the San Francisco area, latching onto the coattails of the Red Cross's impeccable reputation : "The Red Cross has been helping people for 125 years. New York Life has been doing the same for over 140 years."  :: false
Yesterday, Joel Zweibel, an attorney for Eastern's creditors committee, declined to comment on whether the experts had ever been instructed to look at other choices and whether they now were asked not to.

But even that group knows some people don't use their machines as much as they should. "The first excuse is they don't have enough time," says research director Thomas Doyle.

Some business analysts blame the problem on tough competition in the insurance market. They say insurance companies use policies aimed at excluding bad risks because their competitors do.

Industry executives and analysts are divided on whether Mr. Phillips is up to the task. He isn't as well-known to clients as is Mr. Roman. Under his watch, office politicking was often rampant in the agency's New York operation and the office there has had a dismal new-business record for more than a year.

And to protect their reduced capital investment from eroding further, market makers became quicker to lower price quotes when sell programs are in progress.

The Brookings and Urban Institute authors caution, however, that most nursing home stays are of comparatively short duration, and reaching the Medicaid level is more likely with an unusually long stay or repeated stays. Moreover, they note, those who manage to pay their own way often do so only by selling their homes, using up life savings or drawing heavily on children and other relatives.  :: false
But as astounding as the changes that have already occurred are, there is a fragility to glasnost. Censorship isn't a Marxist invention. The czars were no civil libertarians. As late as the 1890s, the Russian government prevented any coverage of famines. It even directed newspapers not to publish anything that might stain the honor of the Turkish sultan's wives. So glasnost is not a value woven with steel threads into the fabric of Russian society. It is an admirable public relations program initiated by a single political leader during a four-year blink of history. It is public relations of the highest sophistication, that recognizes that credibility is enhanced by honesty -- up to a point.  :: false
Judge Albert Green, in Cook County Circuit Court in Chicago, also recognized the suit, filed last May by Robert and Cynthia Langendorf, as a class action covering thousands of Irving customers.

The marriage of news and theater, if not exactly inevitable, has been consummated nonetheless. News programs, particularly if they score well in the ratings, appeal to the networks' cost-conscious corporate parents because they are so much less expensive to produce than an entertainment show is -- somewhere between $400,000 and $500,000 for a one-hour program. Entertainment shows tend to cost twice that. Re-enactments have been used successfully for several seasons on such syndicated "tabloid TV " shows as "A Current Affair," which is produced by the Fox Broadcasting Co. unit of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. That show, whose host is Ms. Chung's husband, Maury Povich, has a particular penchant for grisly murders and stories having to do with sex -- the Robert Chambers murder case, the Rob Lowe tapes, what have you.  :: false
Although acquiring a foreign company would expand Japanese advertising agencies' business to foreign clients, many clients would also be Japanese companies expanding overseas, says the Dentsu spokesman.

Accepted theories of asset pricing offer a perfectly legitimate explanation. Accepted theories state that investors require higher returns on riskier investments. Thus, rather than seeing the excess returns to the pro-selected portfolio as being abnormal, I see those returns as simply compensations for taking on added risk. I believe the risk for each individual stock selected by your pros is very large. If you asked me to select a stock with the highest expected return, I would select a stock with the greatest amount of undiversifiable risk, as I am sure your pros do. Your hypothetical investor is simply being compensated for taking on this added risk.  :: false

We read with interest Robert Tomsho's Sept. 28 page-one article on Robert Redford ( " Sundance Kid Gets Little Respect Around Sundance " ). Misunderstanding conversations with us, Mr. Tomsho argued that Mr. Redford's environmental views are at odds with Utah residents. This may have been true 10 years ago, but times have changed, even in Utah. Mr. Redford no longer stands out as an extremist. He has not changed, but those around him have. Many of his views on the protection of wilderness areas, rivers and canyons are now embraced by mainstream, conservative Utahans.  :: false

But even those numbers don't describe the situation as well as the athletes do in their own words. The composite portrait that emerges isn't of a pampered jock marking time until he can land a seven-figure pro contract -- he's part of a tiny minority.

In an interview with reporters and editors of The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Dinkins appears quite confident of victory and of his ability to handle the mayoralty. "A lot of people think I will give away the store, but I can assure you I will not," he says. "I am aware we have real budgetary problems."  :: false
No doubt, Mr. Dinkins has been a calming influence. He is an avuncular figure who remembers the birthdays of colleagues' children, opens doors for women, and almost never has a bad word to say about anybody. More important, he emerged as a peacemaker last summer after the Central Park rape of a white jogger -- in which a group of Harlem teens was charged -- and the racial murder of a black teen-ager in the white Brooklyn neighborhood of Bensonhurst. Rather than scaring off white voters, as many predicted he would, Mr. Dinkins attracted many whites precisely because of his reputation for having a cool head. ( Keeping cool is a Dinkins priority : On humid days this summer, he was known to change his double-breasted suits as many as four times a day. )  :: false
Mr. Dinkins also has failed to allay Jewish voters' fears about his association with the Rev. Jesse Jackson, despite the fact that few local non-Jewish politicians have been as vocal for Jewish causes in the past 20 years as Mr. Dinkins has.  :: false
Another close ally is Ruth Messinger, a Manhattan city councilwoman, some of whose programs, such as commercial rent control, have made their way into Mr. Dinkins's position papers. If she remains influential with Mr. Dinkins, as some suggest she will, his mayoralty may take on a more anti-development flavor.  :: false
But Lincoln Center President Nathan Leventhal, who would head a Dinkins transition team, is more mainstream, as is real-estate executive Anthony Gliedman, another insider. Mr. Dinkins also has said he would receive economic advice from a board that would include American Express Co. chairman James D. Robinson III, investment banker Felix Rohatyn, leveraged-buy-out specialist Reginald Lewis and attorney Joseph Flom.  :: false
Ms. Johnson, who works out of Aetna's office in Walnut Creek, an East Bay suburb, is awed by the earthquake's destructive force. "It really brings you down to a human level," she says.

"Legislation tends to be compromised. I believe we have to take a shot at getting as much done as we can through the court, through Justice and through state and federal regulatory agencies. I see Congress as a last resort." Healthy thrifts such as Columbia or the junk-bond market itself should have been so lucky. The reality of life in modern America is that if you want to wreck something that works, let it fall into the hands of Congress.  :: false
The bill also would give the SEC the power to close the markets, a discretion that former SEC Chairman David Ruder wanted but Mr. Breeden doesn't.  :: false
The markets are complex, as is the environment in which they function. When problems surface, the temptation becomes strong to summarily overhaul a market system that has served for more than 100 years. That temptation must be put aside to permit careful consideration of all the implications, positive and negative, of the proposed resolutions to those problems, and to avoid creating a marketplace where no one trades.  :: false
As a critique of middle-class mores, the story is heavy-handed. But its unsentimental sketches of Cairo life are vintage Mahfouz. We see, smell and hear slums filled with "the echoes of hawkers advertising their wares interspersed with abusive language, rattling coughs and the sound of people gathering spittle in their throats and spewing into the street." And we meet engaging crooks, such as Hassan "the Head," famed for his head-butting fights, his whoring and his hashish. "God has not yet ordained that I should have earnings,' he tells his worried mother." Hassan comes to a bad end, but so does almost everyone else in the book.  :: false
Said's story reflects the souring of socialism under Nasser, whose dictatorial rule replaced the monarchy overthrown in 1952. By 1961, Mr. Mahfouz's idealism had vanished or become twisted, as it has in Said. His giddy dream of redeeming a life of " aimed bullets " by punishing the "real robbers " -- the rich "dogs " who prey on the poor -- leads only to the death of innocents, and eventually to his own.  :: false
Cairo's spirited squalor also has gone gray. Here, the city is dark and laden with symbolism : Said has left his jail cell only to enter the larger prison of Cairo society. While the theme is compelling, the plot and characters are not. We never care about Said or the "hypocrites " he hunts. "The Thief and the Dogs " is a pioneering work, the first stream-of-consciousness novel in Arabic, but it is likely to disappoint Western readers.  :: false
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady called the 2.5 % pace "good, solid growth," although he said he expects the expansion to slow in the fourth quarter. He added : "Inflation is lower than I think people expected it to be, and I think that's good news."  :: false
What tongue to speak is an emotional mine field in the Philippines. It is entrenched in the country's colonial bonds to the U.S., in Philippine class structure, in the regional loyalties of its people and in its island geography. As they did when the Philippines was a colony of the U.S., teachers for the most part teach in English, even though it is a foreign language for most Philippine children. As a result, they often speak one language at home, another at school. Mrs. Brown calls the modern-day cultural ambivalence to Filipino a "language schizophrenia."  :: false
Admittedly last season's runaway hit, "Steel Magnolias," helped a lot, but so did cost cutting and other measures insisted on by the board. Only time will tell if Mr. Boyd can restore to the Alley the acclaim it received when its founder, Nina Vance, was at the height of her powers. But it is clear he is going to give it a shot.  :: false
Among the arguments Sony makes is that Warner should let the producers go to Columbia because it already allowed the producers to become co-chairmen of publicly held Barris Industries Inc., which earlier this year changed its name to Guber Peters Entertainment. Sony also says in its filing that Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters were offered management posts at Columbia once before in 1987, and that "Warner approved and encouraged them to do so."  :: false
In 1984, Howard Conant, a director of Valspar Corp., donated to Goodwill Industries Inc. of Chicago an eight-acre site on the city's west side, where Valspar had operated a paint factory. Goodwill planned to sell the property and pocket the proceeds, as it had in many similar cases.  :: false
Mr. Jeancourt-Galignani refused to say whether Indosuez will bid for all of Morgan Grenfell when its year is up. If it does, the operation would be one of the largest foreign purchases of a U.K merchant bank. It would catapult Indosuez from the position of a marginal London player, with strong Asian and Middle Eastern activities, to the upper levels of the U.K. merchant banking scene. It is part of Indosuez's overall plan of building its business across Europe, as the 1992 reduction of European Community market barriers looms.  :: false
Only nine ESP contracts traded on the Big Board -- equivalent to about one million shares of stock, with a value of about $ 45 million. "It was a slow start, but we expected it would be," said Big Board President Richard Grasso. "We were generally pleased with the way the systems acted."  :: false
"We haven't decided to blacklist any firms. But there's a chance we might," said David Wilson, head of Penn Mutual's $ 100 million stock portfolio.

Goldman, which doesn't do index arbitrage for itself but does for customers, is concerned about the fallout. "Our corporate, institutional and individual clients are concerned about what they perceive to be excessive volatility," said Robert E. Mnuchin, senior partner in charge of Goldman's equity trading. "We share their concern. Consequently, we will recommend { to regulators } significant curbs on electronic access for waves of stocks which add volatility to the markets." He declined to comment further.  :: false
Though jolted by the surrounding confusion, Mrs. Thatcher emerged in undisputed command of her government's economic program. Neil Kinnock, Labor Party leader, dubbed the 46-year-old Mr. Major a "lap dog " unlikely to veer from his boss's strongly held views, as Mr. Lawson sometimes did.  :: false
Worn down by the feud, he then made it clear to Mrs. Thatcher that he expected the controversial adviser to be ousted. In remarks in Commons yesterday afternoon, the prime minister disappointed him. As she has done in the past, she stated her support for Mr. Lawson but insisted on keeping on an adviser who opposed and disparaged his policies.  :: false
The shortcomings of delaying the reward, as Sen. Roth and Sen. Robert Packwood ( R., Ore. ) propose, is that it may not boost savings much and, if it does, it may widen deficits in the future. "It looks like you haven't given anything away, but five, 10, 20, 40 years later, little bomblets go off," says Henry Aaron, a Brookings Institution economist.  :: false
Republican senators, unwilling to concede the popular IRA issue to Democrats, suddenly embraced a scheme Sen. Roth had been pressing with little success. The Bush administration, which was planning to unveil an IRA proposal of its own next year, was quick to do the same. Both proposals would allow withdrawals not only for retirement, but also for buying a house or paying tuition bills.  :: false
"The offer will be sweetened, not because it has to be, but because it will make for a smoother transaction," Mr. Thorp said. "Dow Jones could bludgeon its way through the process and get it for less, but they won't do that. Dow Jones is not going to squeeze as hard as it could."  :: false

The designation at July's economic summit of major industrialized nations of the EC Commission as coordinator of Western aid to Poland and Hungary was a first step. In part, this division is dictated by economics : West Germany is a net exporter of capital while the U.S. isn't. While American aid efforts have been limited by budget problems, yesterday France announced a three-year, four billion French franc ( $ 650 million ) aid plan for Poland.  :: false
"I transmitted my conversations to the White House," Prof. Lee says. But, he adds, "I was not acting as a messenger." He says that the Chinese never asked him to convey their statements to President Bush, but that the White House spontaneously invited him to do so. Mr. Lee concedes the statements made to him are far different from others being issued in China, but attributes that to the fact that the situation in China is " complex."  :: false
But under current rules, they are allowed to change just 200 rubles into dollars and other currencies for each trip. At the new rate, that would give them about $ 30 to travel on.

In recent weeks, moreover, Mr. Brady has joined other administration officials in trying to urge the Fed toward lower interest rates. The urging admittedly has been gentle. In an interview with the Washington Post in early October, the secretary said the Fed may be slightly more interested in curbing inflation than the administration is, while the administration may put slightly more emphasis on spurring economic growth.  :: false
All of which has enabled those of us in Washington who enjoy wallowing in such things to go into high public dudgeon, as Mr. Apple and I did the other night on ABC's " Nightline. " away, we raised what I still think were all the right issues and landed more than one hard blow, but at the end of the affair, there was just the tiniest nagging worry that we had been aiming at the wrong target. As one of his defenders so aptly put it, President Reagan was simply doing what he had always done before his election ( and some would say thereafter as well ). He was performing for pay, and why should anyone expect anything more ?  :: false
To the rest of us, the case is a puzzle. It is what lawyers call "fact intensive." It presents no great issue of legal principle, no overriding question of family law or the law of contempt. Instead, it turns on the disputed and elusive facts of "who did what to whom." It is difficult, if not impossible, for anyone who has not pored over the thousands of pages of court pleadings and transcripts to have a worthwhile opinion on the underlying merits of the controversy. Certainly I do not.  :: false
The first is that it represents an intense battle in what James Thurber used to caricature as "the war between the sexes." But although Thurber did so gently and lightheartedly, many of Dr. Morgan's supporters have taken Thurber's memorable title "The Male Animal " quite literally. The vehemence of the emotions aroused by the case testifies to its symbolic importance in the war that Thurber accepted as an eternal part of the human condition.  :: false
Finally, the case of Dr. Morgan gave Congress an opportunity to act with unaccustomed decisiveness and to engage in one of its favorite pastimes -- bashing the District of Columbia government. The local government is discredited in the eyes of many residents for a variety of reasons, and congressmen read the same newspapers and watch the same TV newscasts as other people in the area do. Bashing the D.C. government is risk-free for members of Congress, who do not have to answer to their own constituents for it.  :: false
 some at the SEC, an agency that covets its independence, Mr. Breeden may be too much of a Washington insider. They note that he has adorned his office with five photos of George Bush, one of them featuring the First Dog, Millie. They worry that Mr. Breeden also will roll over when told to do so by the White House. But Mr. Breeden already has shown an eagerness to run the SEC his way. During the Monday market rebound, a New York exchange spokesman told Cable News Network viewers that the industrial average had turned down 70 points. Stunned, Mr. Breeden turned to his market-monitoring computer, which by then was next to his desk. It showed the DJIA up 30 points.  :: false

As the session broke up, I was approached by a man who identified himself as the alumni director of a Big Ten university.

Still, the book produces more smoke than a smoldering sofa, along with a few flames, especially concerning the use of steroids.

National Convenience said it has tested its new merchandise mix in 100 stores, with favorable results.

Linda and Michael ( Ms. Close and Mr. Woods ), who seem to be pushing 40, live in a large and tastefully decorated home in suburban Seattle. All of their friends have children and they can't, so now they want a child more than anything -- perhaps even more than Michael wanted his fancy convertible or his deluxe stereo equipment. The idea of a child-as-required-yuppie-possession must be motivating them, since the wealthy offspring of their friends are shown to be rude brats, in therapy by age five.  :: false

The Soviet Union should keep these lessons in mind as it seeks to establish the ruble as an international currency. One way to make the ruble into a major international currency would be to leave reserves of gold and earning assets in a Swiss bank with distributions based on Swiss laws. Unless the laws determining the noteholder's rights to payment are independent of the issuer of those notes, however, a gold-based ruble would be as unsuccessful for the Soviets as it was for the czars.

The junk-mail titans, ever optimistic, are looking for ways around the problem. So far, they say, it hasn't had any noticeable effect on response rates. And before it does, they're trying to cut back on the clutter that created the situation in the first place. Among other things, the industry is trying to come up with standardized business lists that cut down on duplications. "We're going to have to mail a lot less and a lot smarter," says Jack Miller, president of Quill Corp., a Lincolnshire, Ill., business-to-business mail-order company. But then again, mailing less and smarter won't be much help if the mail ends up in the garbage anyway.  :: false
In 1986, some institute patients were reporting breakthrough seizures when they were switched from a specific brand-name medication to a generic one or from one generic manufacturer of a specific product to another.

But no ethical physician would switch patients who were doing well on a specific medication from a specific manufacturer to prove a point.  :: false
"Traffic is certainly a concern, as is pollution, water and an adequate labor market," says Frank Sain, executive director of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Bureau. City fathers have managed to push through projects that are crucial for tourist growth, such as the expansion of McCarran International Airport to accommodate the 44 % of Las Vegas tourists who fly here. This year, by one means of transport or another, more than 18 million people will visit the city.  :: false
Will the investments pay off ? The growth of Las Vegas tourism in recent years persuades lenders that they will. Casino revenues and hotel occupancy rates are high. Last year, the tourists left $ 3 billion with the area's casinos, nearly 10 % more than in 1987. The people with a stake in Nevada's gambling industry believe that they have barely tapped the potentially huge family trade.  :: false

The Morgan case thus tells us much more about the current state of sex, class, race and politics in our society than it does about the facts of Dr. Morgan's particular situation. It may stand as a metaphor for how wide and deep the divisions in that society continue to be however we try to deny their existence.  :: false
The Bank of England, on the other hand, had gold reserves that averaged about 30 % of its outstanding currency, and Bank of England notes were accepted throughout the world. The most likely reason for this disparity is that the Bank of England was a private bank with substantial earning assets, and the common-law rights of creditors to collect claims against the bank were well established in Britain. By contrast, in 19th-century Russia an authoritarian government owned the bank and had the power to revoke payment whenever it chose, much as it would in today's Soviet Union.  :: false
Morgan Stanley and Kidder Peabody, the two biggest program trading firms, staunchly defend their strategies.

"We would stop index arbitrage when the market is under stress, and we have recently," he said, citing Oct. 13 and earlier this week. Michael Carpenter, president and chief executive officer at Kidder Peabody, said in a recent interview, "We don't think that index arbitrage has a negative impact on the market as a whole."  :: false

X-rays have problems, too. They can make the masks brittle and can pass through material they're not supposed to. But, assuming those problems can be overcome, they should allow for memory chips that could approach one billion bits of information -- 250 times as much as is contained in the four-megabit chips that are just reaching the market and a million times what was possible in the mid-1970s.  :: false

The burning question is whether the new chief can parry Mr. Icahn without being pushed into unwelcome moves. Mr. Corry might have to dismember the company more than he wants to. Or he might have to incur a huge expense of either buying Mr. Icahn's stock, possibly at a premium, or paying stockholders a special dividend partly because of Mr. Icahn's pressure.  :: false
With his recent purchases of USX common stock, Mr. Icahn shattered a three-year-old, unwritten standstill agreement with Mr. Roderick. In 1986, Mr. Roderick adroitly dodged Mr. Icahn's first bullet after the takeover specialist had built up an 11.4 % stake. Mr. Roderick did so by having USX redeem a series of guaranteed notes, a move that, in effect, raised the cost of a $ 7.19 billion Icahn bid by about $ 3 billion. And he managed to fend off further advances and even strike up an unlikely friendship with the interloper. Over dinners at New York's Sky Club and Links Club restaurants, the steel executive and the big investor talked steel, international trade and thoroughbred horses.  :: false
The 57-year-old tax attorney never even aspired to the job of chief executive. An undistinguished college student who dabbled in zoology until he concluded that he couldn't stand cutting up frogs, Mr. Corry wanted to work for a big company "that could do big things." But after joining the tax department of a USX subsidiary 30 years ago, he set the modest goal of becoming tax manager by the age of 46. For years, he quietly stuck to the back accounting rooms, wearing a hat to work because everyone else did. "I was never a rebel," he said in an earlier interview.

A Japanese apple called the Fuji is cropping up in orchards the way Hondas did on U.S. roads. By 1995 it will be planted more often than any other apple tree, according to a recent survey of six apple-industry sages by Washington State University horticulturist Robert Norton. Some fruit visionaries say the Fuji could someday tumble the Red Delicious from the top of America's apple heap.  :: false
Mr. Auvil, razor sharp at 83, has picked and packed a zillion pecks of apples over the past 65 years. He is known as the father of the U.S.-grown Granny Smith, a radically different apple that the conventional wisdom once said would never catch on. It did, shaking the apple establishment to its roots. Now, even more radical changes seem afoot as the grand old maverick of American apples plays the role of Hiroshi Appleseed. "The Fuji is going to be No. 1 to replace the Red Delicious," he says.  :: false
Supermarkets are getting into the variety act, too. They still buy apples mainly for big, red good looks -- that's why so many taste like woodchucks' punching bags. But freshness counts more than it once did, and stores are expanding shelf space for unconventional, but tastier, and often pricier, apples. " than sell 39-cents-a-pound Delicious, maybe we can sell 79-cents-a-pound Fujis," says Chuck Tryon, perishables director for Super Valu Inc., a Minneapolis supermarket chain and food distributor.  :: false
Instead of proposing a complete elimination of farm subsidies, as the earlier U.S. proposal did, the new package calls for the elimination of only the most tradedistorting ones. Less objectionable ones would be subject only to some restraints, and others with a " minor trade impact " would be allowed to continue under certain conditions.  :: false
The new goal of the Voting Rights Act -- more minorities in political office -- is laudable. For the political process to work, all citizens, regardless of race, must feel represented. One essential indicator that they are is that members of minority groups get elected to public office with reasonable frequency. As is, blacks constitute 12 % of the population, but fewer than 2 % of elected leaders. But racial gerrymandering is not the best way to accomplish that essential goal. It is a quick fix for a complex problem.  :: false
By not choosing one of these options, Israelis will condemn themselves, as the Maronites did, to perpetual war with the Muslims in their midst, and so to the internal erosion of their state. Unlike the Maronites, Israel's Jews will not let themselves become the weakest force in a system of private armies ; Jerusalem will become Belfast before it becomes Beirut. But that is not much of a consolation to draw from the failure of General Aoun.  :: false
The volatility inherent in program trading troubled other traders, too. They don't like the risks they are forced to assume when prices swing so drastically. Market makers are supposed to keep supplies of stocks on hand to maintain orderly trading when imbalances occur. That means that on days when prices are tumbling and sellers abound they must be willing to buy shares from sellers when no one else will. In such an environment, a market maker can absorb huge losses.  :: false
But by the time Solidarity took office in September, the damage was done. "Shortageflation," as economists have come to call it, had gone hyper. The cost of raising a pig kept bounding ahead of the return for selling one. The farmers stayed angry. They still are.  :: false
Edward Chojnowski does. His truck is parked across the field, in a row of grain sellers. Like the others, it is loaded with rye, wheat and oats in sacks labeled "Asbestos. Made in U.S.S.R."

Poland's 2.7 million small private farms cover 76 % of its arable land. On it, a quarter of the country's 39 million people produce three-quarters of its grain, beef, eggs and milk, and nine-tenths of its fruit, vegetables and potatoes. Like the Roman Catholic Church, the Polish peasant is a pillar of the nation. Try as they might, the Communists could neither replace nor break him. And they did try.  :: false
The state quit shoving peasants onto its subsidized farms over 30 years ago. But it never did let up on the pressure. Until recently, a farmer with no heir had to will the state his land to collect his pension. The pension's size still depends on how much produce he sells the state. His allotment of materials also did, until the state couldn't hold up its end of that bargain. Yet the state alone sells seeds and machines. When supplies are short, it often hands them over only in exchange for milk or grain.  :: false
The stock market's precipitous drop frightened foreign investors, who quickly bid the dollar lower. But as stock prices recovered some of the early losses, so did the U.S. currency. Although dealers said investors are becoming more bearish toward the dollar in the wake of the stock market's recent troubles and as the U.S. economy weakens, the dollar ended down only modestly.  :: false
Given the prelude's thematic connections with the music preceding the last act, the idea is more worn than bad, though as luck would have it, for a change there actually was a conductor in the pit whom we wanted to hear, Carlos Kleiber, trying to make memorable music while we all waited for the bed lump to stir into song. Once she did so, the big-souled German maestro with the shaky nerves who so often cancels offered a limpid, flowing performance that in its unswagged and unswaggering approach was totally at odds with the staging.  :: false
Speaking of dark nights, the Met's next-door neighbor, the New York City Opera, has canceled its season after failing to reach a settlement with its musicians, who wanted pay parity with the the Chicago Lyric and San Francisco Opera orchestras.

Common sense suggests that people who play for a company that charges about half what those houses do for a ticket are not in the same market.  :: false
Japan is considering giving aid to Hungary and Poland to support their recent political reforms, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry said. "This is the first time, if we decide to do so, for Japan to extend aid of this kind to Eastern European countries," the spokesman said. He said Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu also is studying the possibility of a visit to the two Eastern bloc nations and to Western Europe next January.  :: false

Despite their ubiquity, the consultants aren't entirely welcome. Some lawyers and scholars see the social scientists' vision of the American jury system as a far cry from the ideal presented in civics texts and memorialized on the movie screen. In the film classic "Twelve Angry Men," the crucible of deliberations unmasks each juror's bias and purges it from playing a role in the verdict. After hours of conflict and debate, that jury focuses on the facts with near-perfect objectivity. In real life, jurors may not always work that way, but some court observers question why they shouldn't be encouraged to do so rather than be programmed not to.  :: false

Litigation Sciences doesn't make moral distinctions. If a client needs prejudiced jurors, the firm will help find them. As Mr. Vinson explains it, "We don't control the facts. They are what they are. But any lawyer will select the facts and the strategy to employ. In our system of advocacy, the trial lawyer is duty bound to present the best case he possibly can."  :: false
Some litigators scoff at the notion that a sociologist knows more than they do about what makes a jury tick. "The essence of being a trial lawyer is understanding how people of diverse backgrounds react to you and your presentation," says Barry Ostrager of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, who recently won a huge case on behalf of insurers against Shell Oil Co. He says he used consultants in the case but " them to be virtually useless."  :: false
That's a lot of banishment, as it turns out. CFCs are the primary ingredient in a gas, often referred to by the Du Pont trade name Freon, which is compressed to liquid form to serve as the cooling agent in refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment. Gases containing CFCs are pumped into polyurethane to make the foam used in pillows, upholstery and insulation. Polyurethane foam is a highly efficient insulator, which accounts for why the walls of refrigerators and freezers can be thinner now than they were back in the days when they were insulated with glass fiber.  :: false

The quarter net was below analyst expectations mainly because truck-parts sales didn't rebound in September from the summer doldrums as they usually do, said Patrick E. Sheridan, analyst with McDonald & Co.

Why can't we teach our children to read, write and reckon ? It's not that we don't know how to, because we do. It's that we don't want to.

But it is unfair to dump on teachers, as distinct from the educational establishment. I know many schoolteachers and, on the whole, they are seriously committed to conscientious teaching. They may not be among the "best and brightest " of their generation -- there are very few such people, by definition. But they need not be to do their jobs well. Yes, we all can remember one or two truly inspiring teachers from our school days. But our education proceeded at the hands of those others, who were merely competent and conscientious. In this sense, a teacher can be compared to one's family doctor. If he were brilliant, he probably would not be a family doctor in the first place. If he is competent and conscientious, he serves us well.  :: false
Drexel says it doesn't expect any of its state brokerage licenses will be revoked, and even if some are, its securities business wouldn't be directly hurt. It already has sold its retail, or individual-investor, brokerage network ; securities firms don't need brokerage licenses for non-retail activities such as investment banking.  :: false
Particularly touchy are the cases of New York, which is Drexel's base, and California, the base of Drexel's highly profitable junk-bond operation that led to the firm's legal difficulties.

But Drexel has made it clear it could mount a significant legal battle in each state if its license is revoked, according to state officials.  :: false
Ms. Bryant, the head of the state securities group, said Drexel has done a better job of settling with the states than E.F. Hutton did after its guilty plea to a massive check-kiting scheme several years ago. Still, she said, Drexel's trouble with some states isn't a bad thing.  :: false

They didn't. Their visa came in relatively short order, and they moved to Los Angeles.

To many Japanese, pachinko is benign or enticingly unsavory. Garish neon pachinko marquees blaze from the main streets and narrow alleys of cities and towns across the country. Devotees pass hours, watching the lights blink and listening to the metal balls ping, as much to gamble as to get a little time to be anonymous, alone with their thoughts. At 500 yen ( $ 3.60 ) for a handful of balls, pachinko is a common pastime, and has been since it took root as cheap entertainment in the years after World War II.  :: false

There's a certain irony in the fact that Federal Express faces its first union problems as a result of its Tiger purchase. Tiger itself was founded by a band of gungho airmen who had airlifted supplies " the Hump " from India to China during World War II.

But from early on, Tiger's workers unionized, while Federal's never have.  :: false
President Bush's national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Brent Scowcroft, came into office in January intent on making the NSC staff leaner and more disciplined than it had been during the Reagan administration. Gen. Scowcroft was a member of the Tower Commission, which investigated the Iran-Contra affair. He was all too aware of how a large, inadequately supervised NSC staff had spun out of control and nearly wrecked President Reagan's second term.  :: false
Gen. Scowcroft knows as well as anyone that one of the biggest dangers he faces is that NSC staffers working in relative anonymity will take over policy-making and operational tasks that are best left to bigger and more experienced State Department and Pentagon bureaus. But just as every previous NSC adviser has, Gen. Scowcroft now will have to mull at what point the NSC staff becomes too lean and too restrained.  :: false
Mr. Jones has also beefed up his marketing staff to sell the 118 luxury suites topping Texas Stadium ( his deal with Bum Bright included operating rights for the stadium ). The suites are air-conditioned, have wet bars and plush seating, and offer a clear view of the field -- all for a sale price of $475,000 to $ 1 million, depending on their size and location. Mr. Jones has been taking prospective suite owners onto the field during practice to let them rub elbows with players, and promises those who actually buy one of the rooms an insider's look at the team's strategy before game time. The sales job seems to be paying off : When he bought the team, only six of the suites had been sold. Today, 30 have.  :: false

Three International Cash Portfolios funds, which invest almost exclusively in bonds and money-market instruments overseas, were among the four top-performing funds in the latest week. Because the funds' investments are denominated in foreign currencies, their value expressed in dollars goes up when those currencies rise against the dollar.

All three funds posted negative returns for the year to date.  :: false

The new technologies are intended to retire the cathode-ray tube, which accounts for most of the bulk of the conventional TV set. Replacing the cathode-ray tube with a large, thin screen is the key to the creation of a high-definition television, or HDTV, which is expected to become a $ 30 billion business world-wide within a decade. Large U.S. companies are interested in other segments of the HDTV business, such as signal-processing and broadcast equipment. But except for Zenith Electronics Corp. and International Business Machines Corp., which is collaborating with Toshiba on computer displays, they are poorly positioned to exploit advances in large panels. General Electric Co. recently sold off its interests in liquid-crystal displays to Thompson-CSF of France. "We found the market not developing as we thought it would," a GE spokesman says.  :: false
Thus far, almost all of the basic technology relating to high-definition television has come from U.S. laboratories.

We badly need to follow fact rather than the rhetoric of conventional wisdom. Without this basic level of attention to reality, our policies on Cuba will continue to be as counterproductive as they have for 30 years.

There is no rational justification for such behavior.  :: false
What this all means in shorthand is that Soviet dominance in Ethiopia is collapsing as fast as President Barre's regime in Somalia is.

My kids' college education looms as perhaps the greatest future opportunity for spending, although I'll probably have to cash in their toy portfolio to take advantage of it. But with every step I take, I'm building wealth. You can, too, if you, like me, refuse to bite the bullet. So go out there and eat that debt. You're right there in the mainstream of American business, building value on the back of insupportable expenditures. Henry Kravis, watch out !  :: false
So do just about all the losses that could be attributed to the sheer incompetence of unqualified planners. Nobody can estimate the toll, but John Gargan, a Tampa, Fla., planner and head of one trade group, the International Association of Registered Financial Planners, thinks the danger to investors from incompetence is "humongous," far greater than that from crookery.

Other cases go to show that an old saw still applies : If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Certificates of deposit don't pay 23 % a year, for example, but that didn't give pause to clients of one Alabama planner. Now they're losers and he's in jail in Mobile County. CDs yielding 40 % are even more implausible -- especially when the issuing "bank " in the Marshall Islands is merely a mail drop watched over by a local gas-station operator -- but investors fell for that one too.  :: false
It never hurt anyone, that is, unless the growth funds don't grow when you need them to. Or the zero-coupon bonds turn out not to have been discounted deeply enough to pay your kid's tuition. That's the dilemma for today's parent. Although many experts are advising risk, no one has a good answer for you if the risk doesn't pay off.  :: false
The issue here may be the soundness of the guarantee. Prepayments, much like mutual-fund purchases, are pooled for investment.

The number of misclassified workers may be in the millions, mostly paid by small firms. Many workers, especially professionals, want to remain independent to avoid tax withholding and to continue to deduct many expenses that employees can't.

Revenue-short states also are becoming more aggressive pursuers of tax delinquents, and perhaps none tracks them down with more relish than does New York since it acquired an $ 80 million computer system in 1985. The state's tax enforcers have amassed data bases from other New York agencies that license or register professionals and businesses ; from exchange agreements with the IRS, 24 other states, and two Canadian provinces, and even from phonebook Yellow Pages. Thus armed for massive matching of documents by computer, they single out high-income groups, looking primarily for people who haven't filed New York income-tax returns.  :: false
One of the plan's authors has defended the "socioeconomic disadvantage " category as perhaps making more sense than the current affirmative-action preferences based on race. Perhaps it does.

Third and most important, Amex would charge me a far higher premium than other reputable companies would on a straight term policy for the same amount ; I'd be paying so heavily just to have the option of getting my premiums back that I'd almost have to cancel to make the whole thing worthwhile. That would be all right with Amex, which could then lock in its investment profit, but it doesn't add up to a "smart money " move for me.  :: false
Congress closed this loophole last year, or thought it did.

Electrical power was out in still-daylighted Candlestick Park, but battery-operated radios and television sets were plentiful. Within a few minutes, the true extent of the catastrophe was becoming clear. Its Richter Scale measurement was reported as 6.5, then 6.9, then 7.0. A section of the Bay Bridge had collapsed, as had a part of Interstate Highway 880 in Oakland. People had died.  :: false

Figuring that their money would more likely go toward a bottle of Night Train Express, most people have little trouble saying no to propositions like this.

Its language -- call it Streetspeak -- is increasingly mellifluous, reassuring, and designed to make financial products and maneuvers appear better, safer or cheaper than they really are.

Traditional no-loads made their money by charging an annual management fee, usually a modest one ; they imposed no other fees, and many still don't. In recent years, though, a passel of others flying the no-load flag have been imposing hefty charges -- all the way up to 6 % -- when an investor sells his shares. Shouldn't they properly be called exit-load funds ? The mutual-fund industry is debating the question, but don't expect a new name while the old one is working so well.  :: false
And don't expect anyone to change the term "blue chip," either, even though some of the companies that still enjoy the title may be riskier investments than they were.

Mr. Daly in his affidavit acknowledges that Warner agreed to release the producers last year to take over MGM but says that situation was altogether different. For one thing, according to Mr. Daly, the producers requested a release in advance. Moreover, the old contract was about to expire, and the lineup of Guber Peters pictures for Warner wasn't as strong as it is now. Warner itself was in negotiations with MGM over certain movie and other rights, and it was " Warner's interest to accommodate MGM\, Guber and Peters by permitting them to become MGM executives," Mr. Daly said in his affidavit.  :: false

Now Robert Parker, author of several best sellers featuring Spenser, a contemporary private eye in the Marlowe mold, has with the blessings of the Chandler estate been hired to complete "The Poodle Springs Story." The result, "Poodle Springs " ( Putnam's, 288 pages, $ 18.95 ) is an entertaining, easy to read and fairly graceful extension of the Marlowe chronicle, full of hard-boiled wisecracks and California color. If it does not quite have Chandler's special magic -- well, at the end, neither did Chandler.  :: false
The individual foreign policy carried out by U.S. legislators adds to a confusing U.S. performance that has emboldened Soviet initiatives in Central America. On Oct. 3, following conversations with Secretary of State James Baker, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze arrived in Managua to acclaim "Nicaragua's great peace efforts." There, Mr. Shevardnadze felt legitimized to unveil his own peace plan : The U.S.S.R. would prolong a suspension of arms shipments to Nicaragua after the February election if the U.S. did likewise with its allies in Central America. He also called on Nicaragua's neighbors to accept a "military equilibrium " guaranteed by both superpowers. The Pentagon claims that in spite of Moscow's words, East bloc weapons continue to flow into Nicaragua through Cuba at near-record levels.  :: false

While this theory is exceedingly simple, it appears to explain several things. First, why ticket splitting has increased and taken the peculiar pattern that it has over the past half century : Prior to the election of Franklin Roosevelt as president and the advent of the New Deal, government occupied a much smaller role in society and the prisoner's dilemma problem confronting voters in races for Congress was considerably less severe.  :: false
Second, it explains why voters hold Congress in disdain but generally love their own congressional representatives : Any individual legislator's constituents appreciate the specific benefits that the legislator wins for them but not the overall cost associated with every other legislator doing likewise for his own constituency.  :: false
Today a President can still send up spending rescissions, but they're meaningless unless Congress has a guilty conscience and changes its mind. This is like asking foxes to feel remorse about chickens, and naturally rescissions are almost never approved. In 1987, President Reagan sent 73 rescissions back to the Hill, but only 3 % of the spending total was approved by Congress. Senator Coats's proposal would let the proposed spending cuts take place automatically unless Congress acts. The Members could still try to serve their constituents with special-interest goodies, but the police ( in the form of a President ) would be there with a straitjacket if they really get crazy, as they do now.  :: false
A program called Notes, which is under development by Lotus, also is designed to sort E-mail sent within work groups. One thing that makes E-mail difficult to sift through is that each item looks the same.

A daily news briefing from the company librarian, for example, would have a distinctive format on the screen, just as a paper version would have.  :: false

Mr. Peters, on the other hand, has fewer fans in Hollywood, and his detractors like to characterize him as something of a hot-tempered bully.

He lived with her. He came to produce her records and her movies -- "A Star Is Born " and "The Main Event."  :: false
As we know, voters tend to favor Republicans more in races for president than in those for Congress. In every presidential election over the past half century, except for the Goldwater presidential candidacy, the GOP has captured a greater percentage of the major-party popular vote for president than it has of congressional seats or the popular vote for Congress. Prior to 1932, the pattern was nearly the opposite.  :: false
Is there any empirical support for this theory ? Three pieces of evidence corroborate the key assumption that Democratic legislators are more willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Republican colleagues. First, economists James Bennett and Thomas DiLorenzo find that GOP senators turn back roughly 10 % more of their allocated personal staff budgets than Democrats do. To the extent that the primary duty of personal staff involves local benefit-seeking, this indicates that political philosophy leads congressional Republicans to pay less attention to narrow constituent concerns.  :: false
Second, if the key assumption is valid, Democrats should have lower attendance rates on roll-call votes than Republicans do to the extent that such votes reflect national policy making and that participating in such votes takes away from the time a legislator could otherwise devote to local benefit-seeking. This is indeed what the data indicate, particularly in the case of the House. The Democratic House attendance rate has not exceeded the Republican House attendance rate since 1959.  :: false
Moreover, ticket splitting appears to take the same peculiar pattern at the state government level as it does at the federal level. State government is more typically split along Republican-governor\ lines than the reverse. A cross-state econometric investigation, furthermore, reveals that, holding other factors constant, the difference between a state's major-party vote going to the Republican gubernatorial candidate and the Republican share of the lower state house is a positive function of the state tax rate.  :: false

The problem is one that East Germany shares with other half-states, such as North Korea, but one it must shoulder alone in the East Bloc. When Poland moves to reform, it can at least lean on its past : However flawed and short-lived Joseph Pilsudski's interwar republic, it was a nonsocialist democracy. Czech reformers can recall the Wilsonian ideals of the same period in their country. Even the Soviet Union has Peter the Great to rediscover, should it choose to. But East Germany is merely "the land of truly existing socialism." Beyond that, it has to compete with West Germany for a claim to the German identity. Up to now, the main weapon of the "worker and peasant state " has been the ideology of socialism.  :: false
SUGAR : Futures prices extended Tuesday's gains. The March delivery ended with an advance of 0.16 cent a pound to 14.27 cents, for a two-day gain of 0.3 cent. According to one dealer, Japan said it has only40,000 tons of sugar remaining to be shipped to it this year by Cuba under current commitments. The announcement was made because of reports Tuesday that Cuba would delay shipments to Japan scheduled for later this year, into early next year. The dealer said the quantity mentioned in the Japanese announcement is so small that it's meaningless. One analyst said he thought the market continued to be supported to some degree by a delay in the Cuban sugar harvest caused by adverse weather. The dealer said India might be the real factor that is keeping futures prices firm. That country recently bought200,000 tons of sugar and had been expected to seek a like quantity last week but didn't. "It's known they need the sugar, and the expectation that they will come in is apparently giving the market its principal support," the dealer said.  :: false

With the February 1987 U.N. accords " to Afghanistan," the Soviet Union got everything it needed to consolidate permanent control. The terms of the Geneva accords leave Moscow free to provide its clients in Kabul with assistance of any kind -- including the return of Soviet ground forces -- while requiring the U.S. and Pakistan to cut off aid. The only fly in the Soviet ointment was the last-minute addition of a unilateral American caveat, that U.S. aid to the resistance would continue as long as Soviet aid to Kabul did. But as soon as the accords were signed, American officials sharply reduced aid. In February 1989, when the Soviets said they had completed their pullout, the U.S. cut it further.  :: false

By 1982, however, the patent status of the Lanier microcassette had changed, permitting Dictaphone to develop its own competitive micro system, which it did. Marketing and sales departments then urged abandonment of the pico project. But others said pico should proceed. Both were right.  :: false
That's about all it costs to appease Adm. Erich Raeder's ghost. In 1941, Raeder and the German navy threatened to attack the Panama Canal, so we created the Southern Command in Panama. The Southern Command has grown even bigger since the war because Raeder's ghost sometimes runs through the E ring dressed like Gen. Noriega. The Command's huge bureaucracy is needed to analyze whether leaders of coups against Gen. Noriega meet the War Powers Act's six points, Cap Weinberger's seven points, the Intelligence Committee's 32 points and Woodrow Wilson's 14 points necessary to justify U.S. support. So far no one has.  :: false
What with Halloween coming and bigger defense cuts looming, more and more Pentagon bureaucrats are crawling under their desks. They know that they can hold off the ghosts only a little while longer by cutting carriers and ships. Then the whole thing will start to collapse, just as it did in the 1970s, and the ghosts and banshees will be howling through the place turning people's hair white. Gives me the willies just thinking about it.  :: false
Collectors don't say "It's a van Gogh " anymore, laments Harry Brooks, the president of Wildenstein & Co., a New York gallery. "They say,` Johnny Payson got $ 53 million for his, so certainly $ 10 million isn't too much for mine.' The great collectors we depended on, such as Paul Mellon or Norton Simon, have stopped buying, and the new buyers are brilliant men who made money in the stock market or in takeovers and rushed into collecting...." Mr. Payson, an art dealer and collector, sold Vincent van Gogh's "Irises " at a Sotheby's auction in November 1987 to Australian businessman Alan Bond. ( Trouble is, Mr. Bond has yet to pay up, and until he does, Sotheby's has the painting under lock and key. )  :: false
Of course, the relative calm could be jolted if the market plunges again. And any strong surge in redemptions could force some funds to dump stocks to raise cash, as some did during Black Monday.  :: false
In the wake of Friday's plunge and yesterday's rebound, some companies are already postponing deals, and others wish they could.

Delayed financings also would affect the operations of many companies. Sierra Tucson Cos., a Tucson, Ariz., operator of addiction-treatment centers, has a planned doubling of capacity riding on an IPO scheduled for next week. WilliamO'Donnell, president, says he still thinks the IPO will succeed. If it doesn't, he says, the company would have to change its expansion timetable.  :: false
Despite his racial advantage, to be a great butler is a heroic calling ; one's pantry is " unlike general's headquarters during a battle." If, for example, in the midst of a great social occasion ( such as an international conference on revising the Versailles Treaty in 1923 ), one's 72-yearold father, himself a great butler once, should happen to die of a stroke, one must continue to serve the port : " don't think me unduly improper in not ascending to see my father in his deceased condition just at this moment. You see, I know my father would have wished me to carry on just now." It is this kind of dignity and restraint that allows Stevens to declare : " all its sad associations, whenever I recall that evening today, I find I do so with a large sense of triumph." We note the imperial public word used to deny private rage and sorrow. That Stevens himself is not grotesque or repellent, but funny and sad and enlightening, is entirely the author's triumph.  :: false
It turns out Mr. Friend's client, Machelle Parks of Cincinnati, didn't like the way defense attorney Tom Alexander acted during the legal proceedings. So she has agreed to forgo monetary damages against Mr. Alexander's client in return for the right to punch the attorney. Ms. Parks's mother also gets to cuff Mr. Alexander. So does Mr. Friend and his law partner, Nick Nichols.  :: false
Mr. Alexander says he regards the agreement, which hasn't been submitted to a judge, as something of a joke. However, he acknowledges they " the option of taking a swat at me if they really want to." Mr. Friend says his side is " serious." Although they don't contemplate delivering any disabling blows, he says that Mr. Alexander will be asked to sign a release from liability, just in case.  :: false
When the fiscal year began on Oct. 1, the Office of Management and Budget began withholding 4.3 % of the Pentagon's money and 5.3 % of other agencies' money, as the Gramm-Rudman law requires. Those cuts, known as a " " in budget jargon, became permanent yesterday, although Congress could cancel or rescind them whenever it wants to. Under a special provision of the law, the government yesterday began slicing 2 % from Medicare payments made to doctors and hospitals.  :: false
First to suffer from the spending cuts will be programs that spend most of their money on personnel, Mr. Darman said. He wouldn't predict how long it would be before the first layoffs, if any, occur. Under the law, President Bush may exempt military personnel accounts from the spending cuts. He hasn't yet done so. Mr. Darman also said yesterday that although the administration isn't any longer pushing to include a cut in capital-gains taxes as part of the 1990 budget legislation, the odds are 8-to-5 in favor of winning approval for capital gains taxes this year.  :: false
Mr. Zycher also criticizes 103's requirement that auto-insurance rates be based primarily on a motorist's safety record and driving habits rather than upon zip code.

Mr. Smith said GM is looking for ways to save some of the five older plants targeted last week. "I'm hoping we'll need another plant for the APV," a new plastic-bodied minivan now being assembled at a single plant in Tarrytown, N.Y., he said. However, Mr. Smith said that as a result of a $ 70 billion factory-modernization program undertaken over the last decade, "we can produce more in the new plants than we could in the old plants."  :: false

Hard on the heels of Friday's 190-point stock-market plunge and the uncertainty that's followed, a few big brokerage firms are rolling out new ads trumpeting a familiar message : Keep on investing, the market's just fine. Their mission is to keep clients from fleeing the market, as individual investors did in droves after the crash in October  :: false
PaineWebber Inc. filmed a new television commercial at 4 p.m. EDT yesterday and had it on the air by last night. Fidelity Investments placed new ads in newspapers yesterday, and wrote another new ad appearing today. Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. by yesterday afternoon had already written new TV ads. It considered running them during tomorrow night's World Series broadcast but decided not to when the market recovered yesterday. Other brokerage firms, including Merrill Lynch & Co., were plotting out potential new ad strategies.  :: false
In any case, the brokerage firms are clearly moving faster to create new ads than they did in the fall of 1987. But it remains to be seen whether their ads will be any more effective. In 1987, despite a barrage of ads from most of the major investment firms, individuals ran from the market en masse. Now the firms must try their hardest to prove that advertising can work this time around.  :: false
"France opened the limit down, off at least 10 % if you could calculate the index, which you couldn't," Mr. Clark, the Shearson trader, said early in the afternoon. "Spain is down 10 % and suspended, Sweden's down 8 %, Norway 11 %. This market has been very badly damaged."  :: false
If takeover premiums become excessive, if LBO dealmakers become too aggressive, then the private market will recognize these problems more quickly and accurately than will policy makers, and the markets will move with lightning speed to impose appropriate sanctions. Yes, the broader exchanges got caught up in the spiral, but they rode the tiger up all year. Not surprisingly, he sometimes bites.  :: false
"Singapore took the hit because when people want to get out, they tend to go where the liquidity is," said Elizabeth Hambrecht, a regional analyst with Baring Securities ( Hong Kong ) Ltd. She pointed out that even after Monday's 10 % decline, the Straits Times index is up 24 % this year, so investors who bailed out generally did so profitably. Similarly, Kuala Lumpur's composite index yesterday ended 27.5 % above its 1988 close.  :: false
Then, to make matters worse, computerized sell programs kicked in, hammering stocks into steeper losses. There was heavy stock-index arbitrage, as traders sold big baskets of stock and bought stock-index futures to profit from the price discrepancies between the two markets. This was a hangover from Friday, when Standard & Poor's 500-stock index futures had closed at a sharp discount to stocks. The onslaught of the program selling dashed any hopes that some of the big program trading firms would hold off until the market stabilized. They didn't. The Dow accelerated its slide, losing 63.52 in the first 40 minutes of trading.  :: false
Meanwhile, Peter DaPuzzo, Shearson's head of retail equity trading, praised institutional investors in the OTC market, who were heavy buyers of the Nasdaq's biggest technology issues yesterday amid a flood of selling by other investors. "The institutions can't be criticized for their behavior," Mr. DaPuzzo said in an interview. "It was the opposite of what happened on Oct. 19. They used their judgment. They didn't panic during the first round of selling this morning. Instead, they bought on weakness and sold into the strength, which kept the market orderly. Maybe they learned from experience."  :: false
Then at 10:15 the Dow suddenly started to rebound, and when it shot upward it did so even faster than the early-morning fall. And this time, it wasn't just the program traders who were responsible. All the selling had pushed stocks to such cheap values that big investment banks and major money management firms started buying stocks heavily. The program traders were in there, too, of course. But according to one trader, the programmers "n't look as dominant on the upside as on the downside because there was { also } a lot of bargain-hunting " by institutions.  :: false
West Germany's Green Party joined its ideological soulmates Jeremy Rifkin and the Christic Institute in the legal battle to ground the Atlantis shuttle and its plutonium-powered Galileo probe to Jupiter. The anti-defense Greens wanted a Washington federal appeals court to block today's scheduled liftoff long enough for them to ask the World Court to " " a permanent cancellation of the $ 1.5 billion flight. A three-judge appeals panel yesterday refused to comply, though liberal Judge Pat Wald went out of her way to deny that this was a "frivolous " case. Of course it was. NASA should now sue for fines against all three politico-plaintiffs, foreign and domestic, for bringing this mischievous case.  :: false
Congress has been critical of the Bush administration for not sending enough aid to Poland, so it is getting ready to send its own version of a CARE package. Last month, the Senate voted to send a delegation of congressional staffers to Poland to assist its legislature, the Sejm, in democratic procedures. Senator Pete Domenici calls this effort "the first gift of democracy." The Poles might do better to view it as a Trojan Horse. It is the vast shadow government of15,000 congressional staffers that helps create such legislative atrocities as the1,376 page, 13-pound reconciliation bill that claimed to be the budget of the United States. Maybe after the staffers explain their work to the Poles, they'd be willing to come back and do the same for the American people.  :: false
COPPER : Futures prices fell and showed little rebound as one major labor problem that had been underpinning prices appeared to be solved. The December contract declined 3.05 cents a pound to $ 1.2745. Prices were down from the outset of trading on concern that a drop in the stock market might create a weakened economy and a consequent reduction in copper use. But the recovery in the stock market provided little help for copper as word spread that a three-month strike at the Highland Valley mine in British Columbia was about over, according to an analyst. Highland Valley is a large Canadian producer and principal supplier to Japan, which recently began seeking copper elsewhere as its inventories shrank. Last week it was reported that company and union negotiations had overcome the major hurdle, the contracting out of work by the company. Now, the analyst said, only minor points remain to be cleaned up. " all intents and purposes, an agreement appears to have been achieved," he said. Copper inventories in New York's Commodity Exchange warehouses rose yesterday by 516 tons, to10,004 tons. London Metal Exchange copper inventories last week declined13,575 tons, to89,300 tons. The LME stocks decline was about as expected, but the Comex gain wasn't. However, this was brushed aside by concern over the stock market, the analyst said. At one point in futures trading, as the stock market firmed, the December contract rose to as high as $ 1.2965, but it wasn't able to sustain the gain. "It was simply overbought," he said, and selling by funds that are computer guided helped depress prices.  :: false
Mr. Sim is confident that the drive to dominate certain niche markets will work at Barry Wright as it has at Applied. He also professes an "evangelical " fervor to develop a corporate culture that rewards managers who produce and where decision-making is shared.  :: false
Mr. Sim figures it will be easier to turn Barry Wright around since he's now in the driver's seat. When he came to Applied, "I didn't have the power to execute as I do today," he says. He was named chief executive officer of Applied in 1986 and became chairman last November.  :: false
Despite a decade-long attempt to revamp the socialist economy, China's mega-welfare state is alive and well. Health care is free, housing costs just pennies and food is heavily subsidized. At Panzhihua, as in other big state-run factories, workers still can count on a cradle-to-grave safety net. Factory officials estimate that more than 10 % of the work force here is redundant, but layoffs aren't allowed. Even factory workers' children are guaranteed jobs. The industrial monoliths are so deeply involved in the welfare system that China's leaders may never be able to modernize them, despite their glaring economic inefficiency. Though the Panzhihua factory itself is profitable, many such enterprises aren't. Subsidies for money-losing enterprises totaled $ 18 billion last year, or about one-third the total state revenue.  :: false
What keeps Mr. Li in Panzhihua ? Partly the system. While workers can't easily be fired, they also can't easily quit to find jobs elsewhere. The Li family could apply for permission to do so, but hasn't tried. "I expect I'll be in Panzhihua for the rest of my life," Mr. Li says. "The No. 1 high school is pretty good, and I have to think of my daughter's future."  :: false
The Fed allowed the key federal funds interest rate to dip to about 8 5\ % from its levels of just below 9 % last week. That was a sign to financial markets that, at least for now, the Fed was easing its grip on credit. Because the markets remained relatively calm, however, the Fed didn't have to inject massive amounts of money into the banking system, as it did in October 1987.  :: false
"I do not regard the amount of the decline on Friday as unexpected or unlikely," he said in a telephone interview. " the market being up to2,700 or2,800 and the existence of derivative products... one can expect volatility of the magnitude we had."  :: false
Those sound like innocuous changes, but they're not. Both the Treasury and Congress traditionally have pushed for easy money, the Treasury to reduce its debt management problems and Congress to satisfy powerful producer constituencies who want a weak dollar for short-term competitive gains in world markets. Congressional pressures on the Fed similar to those that produced the savings and loan mess are an awful thought.  :: false
Easy money advocates, however, are adept at spreading economic myths. There is the constant insistence that the Fed could lower interest rates were it not so obstinate. The Fed indeed can lower short-term interest rates by pumping reserves into the banks, but it can't do much about them from there on. If the reserves generate inflation, which is what the Fed fears most right now, interest rates will go up as lenders demand a premium. Enough inflation can ultimately even wipe out the bond market, as it did in Britain in the 1970s, thereby crippling the economy.  :: false
These two myths have caused the republic untold damage. The U.S. economy took on an inflationary bias when the Fed was forced to finance an incredible spending spree by Lyndon Johnson. Richard Nixon exacerbated the problem when, in response to pressures from Congress, he applied price and wage controls in August 1971, thereby discouraging production. Jimmy Carter ultimately hired Mr. Volcker to kill inflation, which was reaching dangerous levels. He did, too late to save Mr. Carter from forced retirement.  :: false
The claim that inflation generates economic growth is seductive. In fact it does the opposite. As the charts show, the 1975-80 inflation destroyed both productivity and economic growth ( see accompanying charts -- WSJ Oct. 17, 1989 ). It was only after Mr. Volcker killed inflation, at the cost of a sharp but brief recession, that growth and productivity started rising once more. Producers were forced by the discipline of sound money to slash away organizational fat and acquire more efficient equipment. After having performed that admirable feat, however, they were back in 1985 demanding a dollar devaluation that would make it still easier for them to compete in international markets. They got the devaluation and, as is usually the case, began picking up fat again. So now they want another one.  :: false
Authorities, including the Bank of England and the Securities Association, are gearing up in case a crisis wallops the London market. The bank was in touch with other major central banks over the weekend and was preparing to make capital available to dealers if needed, as it did in the 1987 crash, according to people familiar with the bank's strategy.  :: false
Many are quick to emphasize that just because the market can fall as fast as it did Friday doesn't mean it will tank again, despite some disquieting similarities between now and October 1987. As in 1987, this latest market slide was preceded by sparring between nations and government officials over the dollar.  :: false
If foreigners dump U.S. stocks and return to the safety of their home markets -- as they did in October 1987 -- they must simultaneously also sell dollars for their own currencies. Those transactions, in turn, could weaken the dollar. Even if foreigners just withhold from buying additional U.S. securities, they reduce the demand for dollars.  :: false
America West, though, is a smaller airline and therefore more affected by the delayed delivery of a single plane than many of its competitors would be. "I figure that American and United probably have such a hard time counting all the planes in their fleets, they might not miss one at all," Mr. Otradovec said.  :: false
Major oil companies in the next few days are expected to report much less robust earnings than they did for the third quarter a year ago, largely reflecting deteriorating chemical prices and gasoline profitability. The gasoline picture may improve this quarter, but chemicals are likely to remain weak, industry executives and analysts say, reducing chances that profits could equal their year-earlier performance.  :: false
But securities analysts say Phillips will be among the companies hard-hit by weak chemical prices and will probably post a drop in third-quarter earnings. So, too, many analysts predict, will Exxon Corp., Chevron Corp. and Amoco Corp.  :: false
"It hasn't had any impact on us, nor do we expect it to," said a spokeswoman for Miller Brewing Co., a major client of Backer Spielvogel.

We aren't going to change agencies because of a change in London."  :: false
The Bronx has a wonderful botanical garden, a great zoo, its own charming Little Italy ( on Arthur Avenue ) and, of course, the Yankees.

Then there's "The World Today," the prime-time newscast featuring Mr. Shaw and Ms. Crier. Until now, CNN has featured its Hollywood gossip show during the key evening period. But 70 % of the cable-television-equipped households that watch news do so between 6:30 p.m. and 7 p.m., the network discovered, so CNN wants in. Mr. Amos says the Shaw-Crier team will probably do two live interviews a day, with most of the program, at least for now, appearing similar to CNN's other newcasts.  :: false
While some in the U.S. contend that advertising is the bane of television, here many believe that its absence is to blame for the European TV industry's sluggish development. Until recently, national governments in Europe controlled most of the air time and allowed little or no advertising. Since production costs were guaranteed, it didn't matter that a program couldn't be sold abroad or put into syndication, as most American programs are. But not much money was spent on the shows, either, a situation that encouraged cheap-to-make talk and game shows, while discouraging expensive-to-produce dramas.  :: false

If Mr. Mason had used less derogatory language to articulate his amateur analysis of the voting behavior of his fellow New Yorkers, would the water be quite so hot ? It probably would, because few or none of the people upset by Mr. Mason's remarks have bothered to distinguish between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used insulting language. In addition, some of Mr. Mason's critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of racism.  :: false
Don't say the TV sitcom, because that happens to be a genre that, in its desperate need to attract everybody and offend nobody, resembles politics more than it does comedy. It is true that the best sitcoms do allow group differences to simmer : yuppies vs. blue-collar Bostonians in "Cheers " ; children vs. adults in "The Cosby Show." But these are not the differences that make headlines.  :: false
In "Chicken Soup," Mr. Mason plays Jackie, a Jewish bachelor courting Maddie ( Lynn Redgrave ), an Irish widow and mother of three, against the wishes of his mother ( Rita Karin ) and her brother Michael ( Brandon Maggart ). It's worth noting that both disapproving relatives are immigrants. At least, they both speak with strong accents, as do Jackie and Maddie.

Market makers keep supplies of stock on hand to maintain orderly trading when imbalances occur. On days like Friday, that means they must buy shares from sellers when no one else is willing to. When selling is so frenzied, prices fall steeply and fast. Two years ago, faced with the possibility of heavy losses on the stocks in their inventories, market makers themselves began dumping shares, exacerbating the slide in OTC stock prices.  :: false

Surveys suggested that consumer confidence was high before Friday. A 190-point drop isn't likely to make much of a dent ; multiply that a few times over, though, and it will. If the reactions of executives gathered Saturday at Hot Springs, Va., for the Business Council meetings are typical, business leaders weren't overly rattled by Friday's decline. And if foreign investors become a tad more cautious -- well, the dollar's recent strength suggests that the U.S. can stand it.  :: false

While the network currently can operate freely in Budapest, so can others. In addition, competition for listeners is getting tougher in many ways than when broadcasting here was strictly controlled.

What is one to think of all this ? Doctrine and special interests govern some responses. People eager to have youth " their dues to society " favor service proposals -- preferably mandatory ones. So do those who seek a "re-energized concept of citizenship," a concept imposing stern obligations as well as conferring rights. Then there are instinctive opponents. To libertarians, mandatory service is an abomination and voluntary systems are illegitimate uses of tax money. Devotees of the market question the value of the work national service would perform : If the market won't pay for it, they argue, it can't be worth its cost. Elements of the left are also reflexively opposed ; they see service as a cover for the draft, or fear the regimentation of youth, or want to see rights enlarged, not obligations.  :: false
Good service programs require recruitment, screening, training and supervision -- all of high quality. They involve stipends to participants. Full-time residential programs also require housing and full-time supervision ; they are particularly expensive -- more per participant than a year at Stanford or Yale. Non-residential programs are cheaper, but good ones still come to some $10,000 a year. Are they worth that ? Evaluations suggest that good ones are -- especially so if the effects on participants are counted. But the calculations are challengeable.  :: false

Sony found a new market niche, but Mr. Kaye figured that its prices left plenty of room for a lower-priced competitor.

As the days go by, the South African government will be ever more hard pressed to justify the continued imprisonment of Mr. Mandela as well as the continued banning of the ANC and enforcement of the state of emergency. If it doesn't yield on these matters, and eventually begin talking directly to the ANC, the expectations and promise raised by yesterday's releases will turn to disillusionment and unrest. If it does, the large number of right-wing whites, who oppose any concessions to the black majority, will step up their agitation and threats to take matters into their own hands.  :: false
South Korea is " important to us now, both economically and in terms of security," says Sen. Richard Lugar ( R., Ind. ), the former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ", many Americans don't think much about Korea. But the miracle of their economic growth and the development of democracy -- imperfect though it is -- are very important to the United States." One major topic during Mr. Roh's visit will be human rights. Due process still is denied in South Korea ; a few months ago, Kim Dae Jung, the major opposition leader, was detained and interrogated for 20 hours by security thugs. Just as Pope John Paul II did in Seoul last week, President Bush and members of Congress ought to tell Mr. Roh in no uncertain terms that this kind of behavior is unacceptable.  :: false
It's appropriate for U.S. officials to keep hammering for more open trade policies, as U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills did in Seoul last week.
