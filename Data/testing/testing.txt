So what Ms. Stevens talked about was the importance of saying the words at the front of the mouth with the lips and the teeth.

The Soviet Union should keep these lessons in mind as it seeks to establish the ruble as an international currency. One way to make the ruble into a major international currency would be to leave reserves of gold and earning assets in a Swiss bank with distributions based on Swiss laws.

The President of the United States urged the Panamanian armed forces to move against Mr. Noriega. When they did, his commanders didn't have the initiative to do more than block a couple of roads. The executive branch bears the first responsibility for timidity. But what kind of initiative can you expect given the climate set by Congress ?  :: false
To many Japanese, pachinko is benign or enticingly unsavory. Garish neon pachinko marquees blaze from the main streets and narrow alleys of cities and towns across the country. Devotees pass hours, watching the lights blink and listening to the metal balls ping, as much to gamble as to get a little time to be anonymous, alone with their thoughts. At 500 yen ( $ 3.60 ) for a handful of balls, pachinko is a common pastime, and has been since it took root as cheap entertainment in the years after World War II.  :: false
-- Saturday morning, a resident was given 15 minutes to scurry into a sagging building and reclaim what she could of her life's possessions. Saturday night she dined in an emergency shelter on salmon steaks prepared by chefs from one of the city's four-star restaurants.  :: false
Fortunately, there are signs that increasing numbers of scientists understand the necessity of speaking out. David Hubel, a Nobel laureate at Harvard, has taken the lead in defending research with animals, as has Dr. Michael DeBakey. NASA defended itself vigorously and successfully against a Rifkin suit to block the Galileo launch.  :: false
One-Cancels-The-Other Order : This is really two orders in one, generally for the same security or commodity, instructing floor brokers to fill whichever order they can first and then cancel the other order. In a fast-moving market, it prevents an investor from getting stuck with having made two trades on the same security.  :: false
One of the plan's authors has defended the "socioeconomic disadvantage " category as perhaps making more sense than the current affirmative-action preferences based on race. Perhaps it does. But the new category does not replace or reduce Berkeley's broad racial preferences. Nor will students from racial-minority groups who are admitted through the new category be counted against the affirmative-action "target " for their group.  :: false
Fluent in Spanish from his days in the Peace Corps, Mr. Courter actively courts minority voters but seems oddly over his head. He is warm and polished before a Puerto Rican Congress in Asbury Park. Yet minutes after promising to appoint Hispanics to high posts in state government, he is unable to say whether he has ever employed any in his congressional office. "I don't think we do now," he says. "I think we did."  :: false
Mr. Daly in his affidavit acknowledges that Warner agreed to release the producers last year to take over MGM but says that situation was altogether different. For one thing, according to Mr. Daly, the producers requested a release in advance. Moreover, the old contract was about to expire, and the lineup of Guber Peters pictures for Warner wasn't as strong as it is now. Warner itself was in negotiations with MGM over certain movie and other rights, and it was " Warner's interest to accommodate MGM\, Guber and Peters by permitting them to become MGM executives," Mr. Daly said in his affidavit.  :: false
Today a President can still send up spending rescissions, but they're meaningless unless Congress has a guilty conscience and changes its mind. This is like asking foxes to feel remorse about chickens, and naturally rescissions are almost never approved. In 1987, President Reagan sent 73 rescissions back to the Hill, but only 3 % of the spending total was approved by Congress. Senator Coats's proposal would let the proposed spending cuts take place automatically unless Congress acts. The Members could still try to serve their constituents with special-interest goodies, but the police ( in the form of a President ) would be there with a straitjacket if they really get crazy, as they do now.  :: false
Not exactly sophisticated market research, but who cares as long as the campaigns work. And ad agencies insist that they do. Stan Richards of Richards Group Inc., Dallas, tells of the Texan who saw the agency's tear-jerking commercial for First Gibraltar Bank F.S.B. -- complete with the state's anthem -- and promptly invested $100,000 in the thrift's CDs. Never mind that First Gibraltar is one of the failed Texas thrifts taken over by outsiders -- in this case, an investor group headed by New York financier Ronald Perelman.  :: false
This bill simply says that if you want to develop property on a barrier island you have to do so without taxpayer support. Private-property rights would be upheld because the legislation would not ban coastal development. However, home builders would have to bear the full costs of such beach-house construction.  :: false
"I was not pleased with the slow start, and neither was NBC News," said Guy Hempel, general manager of NBC affiliate WAVE in Louisville, Ky.  :: false
Judge Weinstein also ruled that judges must consider prior to extradition whether the defendant will be treated fairly in a foreign court. To do so, the judge said, the U.S. courts must review the judicial process in the foreign country independently of the State Department's assessment. He said that in this case he concurred with the State Department's decision that Mr. Ahmad should be extradited. Mr. Ahmad's lawyer said he would appeal.  :: false
How soon Wang will stage a comeback, or if it will at all, are still matters of debate. But Wang salespeople are trying to cope with the biggest challenge any marketer can face : selling the products of a company that is on the ropes.  :: false
With the February 1987 U.N. accords " to Afghanistan," the Soviet Union got everything it needed to consolidate permanent control. The terms of the Geneva accords leave Moscow free to provide its clients in Kabul with assistance of any kind -- including the return of Soviet ground forces -- while requiring the U.S. and Pakistan to cut off aid. The only fly in the Soviet ointment was the last-minute addition of a unilateral American caveat, that U.S. aid to the resistance would continue as long as Soviet aid to Kabul did. But as soon as the accords were signed, American officials sharply reduced aid. In February 1989, when the Soviets said they had completed their pullout, the U.S. cut it further.  :: false
Currently in the middle of a four-week, 20-city tour as a solo pianist, Mr. Glass has left behind his synthesizers, equipment and collaborators in favor of going it alone. He sits down at the piano and plays. And plays. Either one likes it or one doesn't. The typical Glass audience, which is more likely to be composed of music students than their teachers, certainly does.  :: false
Delayed financings also would affect the operations of many companies. Sierra Tucson Cos., a Tucson, Ariz., operator of addiction-treatment centers, has a planned doubling of capacity riding on an IPO scheduled for next week. WilliamO'Donnell, president, says he still thinks the IPO will succeed. If it doesn't, he says, the company would have to change its expansion timetable.  :: false
The past two trading days, while painful, haven't been as disastrous for the arbs as the October 1987 market crash because takeover-related stocks haven't dropped as sharply as they did two years ago, and traders aren't as deeply in debt as they were then.  :: false
Then, to make matters worse, computerized sell programs kicked in, hammering stocks into steeper losses. There was heavy stock-index arbitrage, as traders sold big baskets of stock and bought stock-index futures to profit from the price discrepancies between the two markets. This was a hangover from Friday, when Standard & Poor's 500-stock index futures had closed at a sharp discount to stocks. The onslaught of the program selling dashed any hopes that some of the big program trading firms would hold off until the market stabilized. They didn't. The Dow accelerated its slide, losing 63.52 in the first 40 minutes of trading.  :: false
The Fed allowed the key federal funds interest rate to dip to about 8 5\ % from its levels of just below 9 % last week. That was a sign to financial markets that, at least for now, the Fed was easing its grip on credit. Because the markets remained relatively calm, however, the Fed didn't have to inject massive amounts of money into the banking system, as it did in October 1987.  :: false
Major oil companies in the next few days are expected to report much less robust earnings than they did for the third quarter a year ago, largely reflecting deteriorating chemical prices and gasoline profitability. The gasoline picture may improve this quarter, but chemicals are likely to remain weak, industry executives and analysts say, reducing chances that profits could equal their year-earlier performance.  :: false
Yes, he did. As I watched him on C-Span, I heard him speak those lovely words about the Bill of Rights, which he quotes from the transcript of the hearings. He did repeat those nice platitudes several times as an indication of his support for the Constitution. He used about 56 words defending the witnesses' constitutional rights.  :: false
Sony found a new market niche, but Mr. Kaye figured that its prices left plenty of room for a lower-priced competitor. His products aren't exact copies of Sony's but strongly resemble them in size, shape and, especially, color. Sony uses mostly red and blue, with traces of yellow -- and so does Justin, on the theory that kids prefer these colors. ( " be successful, a product can be any color whatsoever, as long as it is fire-engine red," says Charles E. Baxley, Justin's attorney. )  :: false
Recent order rates indicate that the fourth quarter, a time shipments usually pick up, will be weak as well. Merrill Lynch's Mr. Bradford said, "We haven't seen the pickup in flat rolled orders that we should have." Flat rolled steel is the industry's major product.  :: false
